# Trusted Testing Labs

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Golden rule in the Philippines"
    The COA **must have your supplier’s shop name** on it (not just the Chinese factory name).

    If the seller only shows “manufacturer COA” or a generic report without their own name → walk away.
    Real reputable Philippine suppliers always pay to test their own batches and proudly show the report with their name on it.

This is the #1 way to know you are getting legitimate product. [Learn more about why COA is so important →](../coa.md)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Beware of Fake Laboratory Websites"
    **These laboratories listed below are verified and legitimate.** However, it is increasingly easy for anyone to create a professional-looking website. We have documented cases of local Philippine sellers creating fraudulent "laboratory" websites to appear credible.

    **Always verify the legitimacy of a laboratory independently:**

    - Check their physical address and contact information
    - Cross-reference with industry directories and accreditation bodies
    - Call them directly using publicly listed phone numbers
    - Ask your supplier about their experience with the lab
    - Be suspicious of newly created websites with minimal history
