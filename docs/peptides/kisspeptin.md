!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Kisspeptin is a master regulator neuropeptide that potently stimulates GnRH neurons, triggering reproductive hormone release (LH/FSH). Researched for fertility, sexual function, and hypogonadism with strong clinical potential.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 100-200 mcg
- **How Often:** Single dose or 2-3x/week
- **Route:** Injectable (subcutaneous; belly, thigh, upper arm)
- **Cycle:** 2-4 weeks (break 4+ weeks to prevent desensitization)
- **Storage:** 2-8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Kisspeptin is a family of neuropeptides encoded by the KISS1 gene that acts as a master regulator of the reproductive system. It potently stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, making it essential for puberty initiation, fertility, and reproductive function. Research explores its therapeutic potential for infertility, low libido, and reproductive disorders.

## Key Benefits

- Potent stimulation of reproductive hormones (LH/FSH)
- Restoration of natural testosterone production
- Fertility enhancement and sexual function support
- Useful in hypogonadism and reproductive disorders

## Mechanism of action

Kisspeptin binds to GPR54/KISS1R receptors on GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus, triggering pulsatile release of GnRH. This stimulates pituitary secretion of LH and FSH, which in turn promote gonadal steroid production and reproductive function.

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 1,213.42 Da (KP-10) / 6,087 Da (KP-54)
- **Length:** 10-54 amino acids
- **Type:** Neuropeptide family (RFamide)

Amino Acid Sequence:

```
Kisspeptin-10: Tyr-Asn-Trp-Asn-Ser-Phe-Gly-Leu-Arg-Phe-NH2
Kisspeptin-54: 54 amino acid C-terminal fragment
```

_C-terminally amidated peptides derived from 145 amino acid KISS1 precursor protein._

## Research indications

- Reproductive: Most effective — restores reproductive hormone secretion in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and used as an ovulation trigger in IVF.
- Sexual: Effective — investigated for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in men and women.
- Metabolic: Moderate — exploratory research into metabolic effects.

## Research protocols

| Goal                     |                         Dose | Frequency                     | Route            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------: | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Gonadotropin stimulation |                  100–200 mcg | Single dose or 2–3x/week      | SubQ             |
| Fertility support        | 0.4–1.0 nmol/kg (50–150 mcg) | As directed by physician      | SubQ (KP-54)     |
| Sexual function          |                  1 nmol/kg/h | 75 min IV infusion (clinical) | IV infusion      |
| Research protocols       |               0.3–10 nmol/kg | Variable by protocol          | IV bolus or SubQ |

**Timing:** Kisspeptin is best administered in the morning to align with natural circadian patterns of reproductive hormones. For fertility applications, timing should be coordinated with menstrual cycle phase under medical supervision. Avoid daily dosing to prevent receptor desensitization.

## Interactions

!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - GnRH — Synergistic
    - Testosterone — Compatible
    - Estrogen — Compatible

!!! warning "Monitor"

    - hCG — Alternative agent; monitor if combining

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Daily dosing — Causes receptor desensitization; use 2–3x/week maximum

## How to reconstitute

1. Clean work area and hands thoroughly with alcohol.
2. Calculate required bacteriostatic water (BAC) volume.
3. Draw calculated BAC water into syringe.
4. Inject slowly down vial side (not directly onto powder).
5. Gently swirl until completely dissolved (never shake).
6. Store reconstituted solution in refrigerator at 2-8°C.
7. Use within 7 days for KP-10; up to 14 days for KP-54.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White, fluffy powder with proper lyophilized appearance
    - Clear solution after reconstitution with no particles or cloudiness
    - Protected from light in amber/opaque vials or light-protective packaging
    - Slight compaction acceptable if powder dissolves with gentle swirling

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Discoloration or yellowing indicates oxidation or degradation — do not use
    - Cloudy solution after reconstitution indicates degraded or contaminated product — do not use

## What to expect

- Hours 2–5: LH surge peaks (3–5x baseline).
- Hours 12–14: LH returns to baseline.
- Day 1–2: Testosterone/estradiol increase in response to LH.
- Week 2–4: Potential improvements in sexual function and libido.
- Important: Do NOT use daily — causes receptor desensitization.

## Side effects & safety

- Use sterile injection technique to prevent infection.
- Avoid daily administration — causes tachyphylaxis (desensitization).
- Recommended frequency: 2–3x per week maximum.
- May cause cardiovascular effects (vasoconstriction) — caution with heart disease.
- Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
- Consult a reproductive endocrinologist for fertility applications.
- Monitor for signs of ovarian hyperstimulation in women.
