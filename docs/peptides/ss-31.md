# SNAP-8

**Acetyl Octapeptide-3**

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 3-10% concentration
- **Frequency:** 2x daily
- **Route:** Topical (forehead, crow's feet, between brows, nasolabial folds)
- **Cycle:** Continuous use
- **Storage:** 4-25°C (refrigerated for solution)

## Overview

SNAP-8 (Acetyl Octapeptide-3) is a synthetic octapeptide developed as a topical alternative to botulinum toxin for reducing dynamic facial wrinkles. It works by mimicking the N-terminal end of SNAP-25 protein to competitively inhibit SNARE complex formation, thereby reducing acetylcholine release and muscle contractions. Clinical studies demonstrate up to 63% wrinkle depth reduction with consistent topical application.

## Key Benefits

- Non-invasive alternative to Botox
- Reduces expression lines and dynamic wrinkles (reported up to 63%)
- Safe for sensitive skin areas including around the eyes
- No recovery time required

## Mechanism of Action

SNAP-8 mimics the N-terminal end of SNAP-25 protein and competes for binding sites in the SNARE complex. This destabilization prevents efficient neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction, reducing muscle contractions and preventing formation of expression lines and wrinkles.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 1,075.16 Da
- **Length:** 8 amino acids
- **Type:** Acetylated octapeptide with C-terminal amidation

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

```
Ac-Glu-Glu-Met-Gln-Arg-Arg-Ala-Asp-NH2
```

## Research Protocols

| Goal                        |                     Dose | Frequency  | Route                |
| --------------------------- | -----------------------: | ---------- | -------------------- |
| General Anti-Aging          |       3-5% concentration | 2x daily   | Topical serum/cream  |
| Intensive Wrinkle Treatment |      5-10% concentration | 2x daily   | Targeted application |
| Eye Area Treatment          |       3-5% concentration | 2x daily   | Eye cream/serum      |
| Forehead Lines              |      5-10% concentration | 2x daily   | Direct application   |
| Preventive Use              |         3% concentration | 1-2x daily | Daily moisturizer    |
| Combined Peptide Protocol   | 3-5% with other peptides | 2x daily   | Multi-peptide serum  |

**Timing:** Apply SNAP-8 to clean, dry skin before heavier products. Morning application should be followed by sunscreen. Evening application can be layered with retinol on alternate days to minimize irritation.

## How to Reconstitute / Use

1. Cleanse face thoroughly with gentle, pH-balanced cleanser.
2. Pat skin dry and wait 1-2 minutes for complete drying.
3. If using powder: dissolve in distilled water or add to serum base at 3-10% concentration.
4. Apply small amount (pea-sized) to target areas: forehead, around eyes, between brows.
5. Gently pat product into skin - avoid rubbing which can reduce efficacy.
6. Allow 2-3 minutes for absorption before applying additional products.
7. Follow with moisturizer and sunscreen (daytime) to protect treated skin.

## Peptide Interactions

- Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide-3): Synergistic
- Leuphasyl: Synergistic
- GHK-Cu: Compatible
- Hyaluronic Acid: Synergistic
- Niacinamide: Compatible
- Retinol: Use Caution (introduce slowly, alternate evenings)
- Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid): Requires Timing
- AHA/BHA Acids: Use Caution
- Matrixyl: Synergistic
- Copper Peptides: Use Caution

## Quality Indicators

- Clear, colorless to slightly yellowish solution; no visible particles or cloudiness.
- pH between 3.0-5.0 is optimal for stability and skin compatibility.
- Proper packaging (airless pump, dark glass, or UV-protected container) to prevent degradation.
- Gradual visible results with continued use (2-4 weeks).
- Verify concentration — many commercial products contain subtherapeutic amounts (look for 3-10% SNAP-8).
- Discard if cloudy, discolored, or strong odor present.

## What to Expect

- Day 1-7: Skin may feel slightly smoother; minimal visible changes as peptide accumulates in tissue.
- Week 2-3: Initial reduction in fine lines, especially with facial expressions.
- Week 4: Significant wrinkle depth reduction (average reductions reported); expression lines less pronounced.
- Week 6-8: Maximum efficacy achieved (reports up to 63% reduction).
- Ongoing: Maintained results with continued use; effects gradually diminish over 2-4 weeks if discontinued.

## Side Effects & Safety

- Perform patch test on inner arm 24 hours before first facial use to check for sensitivity.
- Generally well-tolerated on sensitive skin and delicate eye area.
- Mild irritation or redness may occur at higher concentrations (5-10%).
- Avoid combining with strong acids (AHAs/BHAs) in the same application — use at different times.
- If using retinol, introduce SNAP-8 slowly and consider alternating evenings.
- Not intended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding (insufficient safety data).
- Discontinue use if persistent irritation, redness, or allergic reaction occurs.
