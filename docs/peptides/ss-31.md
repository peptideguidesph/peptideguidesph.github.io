**Elamipretide | Mitochondrial-Targeted Peptide | Cardiolipin Protector**

**Tags:** SS-31, Elamipretide, Bendavia, Mitochondrial, Energy, Cardiolipin, Mitochondrial disease

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    SS-31 (Elamipretide) is a small aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide that selectively targets mitochondria by binding to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It protects against oxidative damage, improves ATP production, and shows promise for age-related conditions, cardiovascular health, and mitochondrial disorders.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 5–40 mg (protocol-dependent)
- **Typical Clinical Dose (quick start):** 10–20 mg
- **How Often:** Once daily (morning preferred) or as specified by protocol
- **Route:** Injectable (Subcutaneous or IV; IV infusion for clinical protocols)
- **Cycle:** 4–12 weeks continuous
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

SS-31, also known as Elamipretide or Bendavia, is a small aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide that selectively targets mitochondria. Unlike traditional antioxidants, SS-31 specifically binds to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, protecting it from oxidative damage and improving cellular energy production. This unique mechanism makes it particularly promising for age-related conditions, heart disease, and mitochondrial disorders.

## Key Benefits

- **Directly protects mitochondria** from oxidative damage
- **Improves cellular energy production** by enhancing ATP synthesis
- **Reduces oxidative stress** at the source (mitochondrial level)
- **Enhances exercise capacity** and endurance performance
- **Supports cardiovascular health** with cardioprotective effects
- **Potential for mitochondrial disorders** and age-related decline

## Mechanism of Action

SS-31 selectively binds to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, preventing lipid peroxidation and optimizing electron transport chain function. By stabilizing the structure and function of cardiolipin, it preserves the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane, improving energy production efficiency and reducing harmful reactive oxygen species. This targeted mitochondrial support leads to enhanced ATP generation and cellular protection against age-related dysfunction.

## How to Reconstitute

1. **Clean work surface** with alcohol and wash hands thoroughly with sterile technique.
2. **Wipe vial tops** with alcohol pad; allow to dry completely.
3. **Draw appropriate amount** of bacteriostatic water (typically 1–2 mL per 10–40 mg vial).
4. **Inject water slowly** into the SS-31 vial, aiming at the glass wall to minimize foam.
5. **Gently swirl** (do not shake) until completely dissolved — SS-31 dissolves readily, typically within 2–3 minutes.
6. **Inspect solution** — should be clear and colorless with no visible particles or cloudiness.
7. **For IV use**, may require sterile filtration through a 0.22 μm filter to ensure sterility.
8. **Label vial** with concentration (e.g., "SS-31 10mg/mL"), date reconstituted, and expiration (typically 28 days if refrigerated).
9. **Store immediately** in refrigerator at 2–8°C; protect from light exposure.
