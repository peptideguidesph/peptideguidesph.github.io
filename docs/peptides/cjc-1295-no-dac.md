!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    CJC-1295 (without DAC), also called Modified GRF 1-29 or Mod GRF 1-29, is a short-acting GHRH analogue that produces pulsatile growth hormone release with a plasma half-life around 30 minutes.

## Overview

CJC-1295 without DAC is designed to trigger discrete GH spikes that more closely mimic natural physiology, reducing receptor desensitization risk compared with longer-acting DAC-modified variants.

## Key Benefits

- Restores physiological GH pulsatility
- Minimal receptor desensitization when dosed appropriately
- Short half-life allows fine control over GH pulses

## Mechanism of Action

CJC-1295 (no DAC) binds GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotrophs, raising intracellular cAMP and prompting timed GH secretion in pulses rather than continuous exposure.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 3,367.97 Da
- **Length:** 30 amino acids
- **Type:** GHRH analogue (Mod GRF 1-29)

_Modified GRF(1-29) with increased stability; requires frequent dosing due to short half-life._

## Research Indications

- Growth hormone pulse restoration
- Anti-aging / wellness support (IGF-1 elevation)
- Support pituitary-somatotroph function without suppression

## Research Protocols

| Goal                  |        Dose | Frequency                                 | Route        |
| --------------------- | ----------: | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Anti-Aging / Wellness |     100 mcg | 2× daily (morning + bedtime)              | Subcutaneous |
| Body Composition      | 100–150 mcg | 3× daily (morning, post-workout, bedtime) | Subcutaneous |
| Maximum GH Release    |     200 mcg | 2–3× daily with a GHRP                    | Subcutaneous |
| Sleep Enhancement     | 100–200 mcg | Once at bedtime                           | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Administer at least 30 minutes away from food for best absorption. Morning dose on waking and evening dose before bed are commonly used for ideal pulsatile responses.

## How to Reconstitute (practical notes)

1. Use bacteriostatic water and sterile technique.
2. For a 2 mg vial, drawing 2 mL BAC water yields approximately 100 mcg per 10 units (example concentrations vary — calculate precisely).
3. Inject water slowly down the vial wall and gently roll to mix; do not shake.
4. Solution should be clear; cloudy or discolored solution indicates degradation — discard.
5. Label vial with reconstitution date and concentration and refrigerate immediately.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - COA showing >98% purity
    - Proper cold-chain shipping and vacuum-sealed vials

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Pre-mixed solutions (prefer lyophilized powder)

## What to Expect

- Day 1–7: Improved sleep quality, vivid dreams may occur
- Week 2–4: Better recovery, reduced post-exercise soreness
- Week 4–8: Noticeable skin improvements and early body-composition changes
- Week 8–12+: Gradual lean-mass gains and reduced body fat with sustained use

## Side Effects & Safety

- Generally well tolerated at recommended doses
- Possible transient flushing or warmth after injection
- Monitor blood glucose in people with diabetes (GH affects insulin sensitivity)
- Avoid use with active cancer or in those with diabetic retinopathy or severe renal disease
