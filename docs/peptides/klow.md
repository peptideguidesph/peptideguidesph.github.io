# KLOW Protocol

**Tags:** KLOW, Combination Peptide, GHK-Cu, TB-500, BPC-157, KPV

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    KLOW is a four-peptide research combination (GHK-Cu, TB-500, BPC-157, KPV) designed for tissue repair, anti-inflammation, and cellular regeneration. No clinical trials exist for this specific combination; it remains investigational with theoretical benefits based on complementary mechanisms.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 200-500 mcg total blend (125–312 mcg GHK‑Cu, 25–62 mcg each other)
- **How Often:** Once daily typical
- **Route:** Injectable (subcutaneous; rotate abdomen, thighs, upper arms)
- **Cycle:** 4–6 weeks reported (4–6 weeks on, 2–4 weeks off)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

KLOW is a research peptide combination that builds upon the GLOW protocol by adding KPV for enhanced anti-inflammatory effects. This 80 mg blend typically contains 50 mg GHK‑Cu, 10 mg TB‑500, 10 mg BPC‑157, and 10 mg KPV in a 5:1:1:1 ratio. While individual components have varying levels of research support, no clinical trials have examined this specific four‑peptide combination. The protocol remains investigational with theoretical benefits based on complementary mechanisms.

## Key Benefits

- Theoretical synergistic effects from four peptides: tissue repair, anti‑inflammation, cellular regeneration
- Potential enhanced tolerability and single‑injection convenience compared with administering separate peptides

## Mechanism of action

Each peptide contributes different mechanisms: GHK‑Cu modulates gene expression, TB‑500 enhances cell migration, BPC‑157 upregulates growth factors, and KPV inhibits NF‑κB mediated inflammation.

## Research indications

- **Wound Healing:** Multi‑modal healing addressing tissue repair through complementary pathways.
- **Recovery:** Effective in user reports for recovery and tolerability.
- **Anti‑Inflammatory:** Moderate — KPV may reduce injection site reactions compared to GLOW.

## Research protocols

| Goal                         |                                                         Dose | Frequency                   | Route        |
| ---------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Common Research Protocol     | 200–500 mcg total (125–312 mcg GHK‑Cu, 25–62 mcg each other) | Once daily                  | Subcutaneous |
| Conservative Approach        |                                          200 mcg total daily | Once daily evening          | Subcutaneous |
| Standard 80 mg Vial Protocol |   Reconstitute with 4 mL = 20 mg/mL, use 0.01–0.025 mL daily | Once daily                  | Subcutaneous |
| Cycling Protocol             |                                                     As above | 4–6 weeks on, 2–4 weeks off | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Evening dosing is common practice but not research‑backed; some prefer morning administration.

    - Growth Hormone — Avoid combination

## How to reconstitute

1. Clean vial top with alcohol pad.
2. Add 2–5 mL bacteriostatic water (4 mL creates 20 mg/mL).
3. Gently swirl — do not shake.
4. Solution should be clear to slightly cloudy.
5. Label with date and concentration.
6. Store in refrigerator immediately.
7. Use within 4–6 weeks.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Sourced from reputable research supplier with quality control processes
    - Batch information and ratios documented
    - Certificate of analysis (COA) provided

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Marketed for human therapeutic use (not research-only)
    - Batch variability with undocumented ratios or purity
    - No certificate of analysis provided
    - Unregulated market source with quality and contamination risks

## What to expect

- Individual responses vary widely with no predictable timeline.
- Some users report reduced inflammation within days.
- Wound healing effects may take 2–4 weeks if they occur.
- No clinical data exists to set realistic expectations; placebo effects may contribute.

## Side effects & safety

- No safety studies on the four‑peptide combination.
- Individual peptides generally well‑tolerated in research, but long‑term effects are unknown.
- Injection site reactions are common even with KPV.
- FDA has not approved any component for therapeutic use.
- Quality and contamination risks exist in the unregulated market.
