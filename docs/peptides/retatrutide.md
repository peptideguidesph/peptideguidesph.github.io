<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    Retatrutide (LY3437943) is a triple GLP‑1/GIP/glucagon agonist showing very large weight-loss effects in Phase II trials and promising glycemic benefits.

## Quick facts

- **Typical Dose:** 0.5–12 mg weekly
- **How Often:** Once weekly
- **Route:** Injectable — subcutaneous (abdomen, thigh, upper arm); rotate sites weekly to prevent lipodystrophy
- **Cycle:** Continuous therapy (effects reverse on discontinuation)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Retatrutide (LY3437943) is a novel triple hormone receptor agonist targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors. Phase II trials achieved 24.2% weight loss at 48 weeks — the highest recorded for any obesity medication. Currently in Phase III development by Eli Lilly for obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment.

## Key Benefits

- Triple hormone receptor activation provides superior weight loss (24.2%), improved glycemic control, and enhanced cardiovascular benefits compared to single or dual agonists.

## Mechanism of action

Activates GLP‑1 for appetite suppression, GIP for insulin sensitivity, and glucagon for increased energy expenditure and hepatic fat oxidation.

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 4,731.33 Da
- **Length:** 39 amino acids
- **Type:** Triple GLP‑1/GIP/glucagon agonist

## Research indications

- **Weight Loss** — Most Effective: clinical trials show 17.5% at 24 weeks and 24.2% at 48 weeks
- **Diabetes** — Effective: improved glycemic control and HbA1c reductions
- **Cardiovascular** — Moderate: improvements observed in metabolic and liver fat endpoints

## Research protocols

| Goal                                    |         Dose | Frequency   | Route                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------: | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Conservative Starting Dose (Week 1–4)   |       0.5 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Low Maintenance Dose (Week 4–8)         |         1 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Standard Escalation (Week 8–12)         |         2 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Moderate Weight Loss (Week 12–16)       |         4 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Advanced Weight Loss (Week 16–20)       |         8 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Maximum Efficacy (Week 20+)             |        12 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Type 2 Diabetes - Conservative Start    |     0.5–1 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Type 2 Diabetes - Maintenance           |       4–8 mg | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |
| Clinical Trial Protocol (Obesity Study) | 1–2 mg start | Once weekly | Subcutaneous injection |

**Timing:** Administer on the same day each week for consistent hormone regulation. Can be taken with or without food due to subcutaneous administration.

## How to reconstitute

1. Remove Retatrutide vial from refrigeration and allow to reach room temperature (15–20 minutes).
2. Clean vial top with alcohol swab and allow to air dry completely.
3. Add calculated amount of bacteriostatic water slowly down the side of the vial to minimize foaming.
4. Gently swirl the vial in circular motions — DO NOT shake vigorously as this may damage the peptide structure.
5. Allow to fully dissolve (may take 2–3 minutes); solution should be clear and colorless.
6. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated (2–8°C) and use within 28 days.
7. Draw calculated dose using an appropriate syringe and inject subcutaneously into abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.
8. Rotate injection sites weekly to prevent lipodystrophy and maintain absorption consistency.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Pharmaceutical-grade white powder (lyophilized)
    - Proper cold-chain maintenance with temperature-controlled shipping
    - Clear reconstituted solution without particles or cloudiness
    - Stable extended half-life effects (consistent between weekly doses)
    - Batch/lot number and expiration date clearly labeled

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Source verification critical — verify pharmaceutical-grade sourcing to avoid counterfeits
    - Rapid tolerance or unusual side-effect profile may indicate degraded or counterfeit product
    - Discoloration or cloudy reconstituted solution
    - Broken cold-chain history or improper storage

## What to expect

- Week 1–2: Initial appetite suppression and mild GI effects as body adapts
- Week 2–4: Noticeable reduction in cravings and early weight loss (2–5%)
- Week 4–8: Significant appetite control and steady weight loss (5–10%)
- Week 8–16: Substantial weight reduction (10–18%) with metabolic improvements
- Week 16–24: Major weight loss milestones (15–22%) and liver fat reduction
- Week 24–48: Maximum clinical efficacy (20–24.2%) with comprehensive metabolic improvements

## Side effects & safety

- Most common: gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) — typically mild to moderate and dose‑dependent
- Start conservatively (0.5 mg weekly) to minimize GI effects; escalate every ~4 weeks
- Monitor for pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain) and discontinue if suspected
- Monitor heart rate and cardiovascular status during dose escalation
- Contraindicated with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2
- May cause rapid weight loss — monitor and adjust dose if needed
