# CJC-1295 (with DAC)

**Tags:** GHRH analogue, DAC, Long-acting, Growth Hormone

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    CJC-1295 with DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) is a long-acting, albumin-binding GHRH analogue engineered for extended duration (half-life ~6–8 days), providing sustained GH and IGF-1 elevation with weekly dosing.

## Overview

CJC-1295 with DAC is engineered to prolong circulation time via albumin binding, producing continuous GHRH receptor stimulation rather than the short GH pulses of natural physiology.

## Key Benefits

- Weekly dosing convenience
- Sustained GH/IGF-1 elevation for days after a single injection
- Noticeable body-composition and recovery effects at clinical doses

## Mechanism of Action

The DAC moiety increases plasma albumin binding, extending circulation time and providing continuous GHRH receptor stimulation.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 3,647.28 Da
- **Length:** 30 amino acids
- **Type:** GHRH analog with DAC

```

_Note: DAC extends half-life to ~6–8 days, allowing weekly administration._

## Research Indications

- Sustained growth hormone elevation (primary indication)
- IGF-1 optimization for clinical/research uses
- Body-composition improvements and recovery support

## Research Protocols

| Goal                    |                       Dose | Frequency              | Route        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------: | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Conservative Anti-Aging |                       1 mg | Once weekly            | Subcutaneous |
| Standard Protocol       |                       2 mg | Once weekly            | Subcutaneous |
| Split Dosing            |                       1 mg | Twice weekly (Mon/Thu) | Subcutaneous |
| Loading Protocol        | 2 mg first week, then 1 mg | Weekly                 | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Injection timing is flexible due to long half-life; many prefer morning dosing to monitor side effects.

## How to Reconstitute (practical notes)

1. Clean both vial tops with alcohol and allow to dry.
2. Use bacteriostatic water (BAC) — sterile technique is essential.
3. For 2 mg vial: add 1 mL BAC water (creates ~2 mg/mL concentration).
4. For 5 mg vial: add 2.5 mL BAC water (creates ~2 mg/mL concentration).
5. Inject water slowly down vial wall to reduce foaming — DAC peptides foam easily.
6. Let sit ~5 minutes, then gently roll to mix.
7. Label with date and concentration and refrigerate.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - DAC peptides with COA showing >98% purity
    - Proper labeling stating "with DAC" and clear vendor COA

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Impurities on COA or missing DAC labeling
    - Excessive foaming that does not settle or cloudy solution

## What to Expect

- Week 1: possible water retention, improved sleep, increased appetite
- Week 2–3: recovery improvements, some report joint discomfort
- Week 4–6: visible body-composition changes and increased vascularity
- Week 6–8: continued benefits; monitor for desensitization signs
- Post-cycle: IGF-1 typically declines to baseline within 2–3 weeks

## Side Effects & Safety

- Higher side-effect incidence compared with pulsatile protocols
- Common: water retention, joint pain, carpal tunnel symptoms
- Monitor for signs of excessive GH (acral growth)
- Not recommended for people with active cancer or uncontrolled diabetes
- May worsen sleep apnea in predisposed individuals
- Regular IGF-1 monitoring advised for extended use

    - Human | 30-60 mcg/kg | Single injection | 12 subjects

    Demonstrated sustained GH and IGF-1 elevation for 6-10 days following a single injection, with peak levels 2-4x baseline maintained throughout.

    - Human | Multiple doses | 90 days | 48 subjects

    Established optimal dosing at 1-2 mg weekly, showing dose-dependent IGF-1 increases but also higher side effect incidence at doses above 2 mg.

    - Animal model | 6 months | Weekly dosing

    Chronic administration led to sustained IGF-1 elevation but some evidence of reduced GH pulse amplitude, suggesting partial desensitization.
