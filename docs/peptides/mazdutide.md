!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Mazdutide (IBI362/LY3305677) is a dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist showing up to ~20% weight loss and superior glycemic control in Phase 3 trials. Once-weekly dosing with fatty-acid conjugation; approved/under review in select markets.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 3–9 mg weekly (once weekly)
- **Route:** Injectable — Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm (rotate sites)
- **Cycle:** 48–60+ weeks (typical duration)
- **Storage:** Lyophilized: -20°C long-term; Reconstituted: 2–8°C, use within 30 days

## Overview

Mazdutide (IBI362 / LY3305677) is a dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist — a synthetic oxyntomodulin analog. It combines GLP-1–mediated appetite suppression with glucagon-driven increases in energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Phase 3 trials (GLORY-1, GLORY-2) demonstrated large weight reductions (up to ~20% at higher doses) and improved glycemic control versus comparators.

## Key Benefits

- Substantial weight loss (up to ~20% reported in trials)
- Superior glycemic control vs semaglutide in head-to-head data
- Increased energy expenditure via glucagon receptor activation
- Improvements in cardiometabolic markers (BP, lipids, liver fat)
- Once-weekly dosing enabled by fatty-acid conjugation

## Mechanism of action

Dual agonism at GLP-1 and glucagon receptors: GLP-1 promotes insulin release, reduces appetite and slows gastric emptying; glucagon activation increases energy expenditure and improves hepatic fat metabolism. The combination yields synergistic weight-loss effects while GLP-1 helps counteract glucagon's glycemic effects.

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 4,563.1 Da
- **Length:** 33 amino acids
- **Type:** Oxyntomodulin analog with fatty acid conjugation

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

```
33-amino acid linear synthetic peptide conjugated to C20 fatty diacid moiety through hydrophilic linker at Lys20
```

_C20 fatty diacid conjugation via hydrophilic linker extends half-life for once-weekly dosing._

## Research Indications

- Weight loss — GLORY trials showed substantial efficacy (including high-dose 9 mg results)
- Metabolic syndrome improvements (waist, BP, triglycerides, LDL, liver fat)
- Liver fat reduction (exploratory analyses suggest MASLD/MASH benefits)
- Type 2 diabetes — improved glycemic control in trials, including head-to-head comparisons

## Research protocols

| Goal                                    |                   Dose | Frequency   | Route          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------: | ----------- | -------------- |
| Weight loss initiation (3 mg target)    |          1.5 mg → 3 mg | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Weight loss progression (4.5 mg target) | 1.5 mg → 3 mg → 4.5 mg | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Weight loss optimization (6 mg target)  |     2 mg → 4 mg → 6 mg | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Maximum weight loss (9 mg target)       |     3 mg → 6 mg → 9 mg | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| T2D management (mild–moderate)          |        3–4.5 mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| T2D with obesity (intensive)            |          6–9 mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |

**Timing:** Inject any time of day, with or without food. Choose a consistent day each week. If a dose is missed, take as soon as possible within 3 days, then resume regular schedule.

## Interactions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - GLP-1 class agents — Metabolic synergy (but avoid dual therapy without medical oversight)
    - Metformin — Compatible

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Insulin — Monitor glucose closely; reduce insulin doses as needed
    - Sulfonylureas — Monitor glucose closely; reduce doses as needed
    - Other antidiabetic agents — Risk of hypoglycemia; coordinate with healthcare provider

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - GLP-1 receptor agonist dual therapy — Avoid without medical oversight
    - Personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma — Contraindicated (GLP-1 class warning)
    - MEN2 syndrome — Contraindicated
    - Pregnancy and breastfeeding — Not recommended

## How to Reconstitute

1. Remove vial from freezer/refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature (15–20 minutes).
2. Clean vial top with an alcohol swab; allow to air dry completely.
3. Calculate reconstitution volume based on desired concentration.
4. Draw the calculated amount of bacteriostatic water (BAC) into a syringe; remove air bubbles.
5. Insert needle at a 45° angle against the vial wall — not directly into the powder.
6. Inject BAC slowly down the side of the vial (drop by drop) to prevent foaming.
7. Remove needle and gently swirl vial in a circular motion — never shake vigorously.
8. If cloudiness persists, allow solution to sit 2–3 minutes then swirl gently until clear.
9. Final solution should be completely clear and colorless — discard if cloudy or containing particles.
10. Label vial with reconstitution date and concentration.
11. Store reconstituted solution at 2–8°C; use within 30 days.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White to off-white lyophilized powder, light and fluffy without clumps
    - Clear, colorless reconstituted solution with no visible particles
    - Intact vial seal with clear mg dosage, visible batch numbers, and expiration date
    - Proper storage maintained (temperature control, protected from light, no freeze–thaw cycles)
    - Source verification with purity testing and supplier reputation confirmed

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Clumping, discoloration, or moisture in lyophilized powder — do not use
    - Persistent cloudiness or visible particles in reconstituted solution — do not use
    - Broken vial seal or missing batch information — avoid
    - Improper storage history or temperature excursions — quality compromised

## What to expect (timeline)

- Week 1–2: Appetite reduction, possible mild nausea
- Week 3–4: Early weight loss (1–2%), improved satiety
- Week 4–8: Dose escalation phase; GI symptoms typically improve; 3–5% weight loss
- Week 8–16: Steady weight loss (7–12%), energy-expenditure effects appear
- Week 16–32: Significant weight reduction (12–17%), metabolic markers improving
- Week 32–60: Peak effects (up to ~20% weight loss), sustained improvements in BP, lipids, glucose

## Side effects & safety

- Start low and escalate every ~4 weeks to reduce GI side effects
- Common: GI symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) — usually mild–moderate and transient
- Increased heart rate (observed 5–17 bpm in trials)
- Monitor for pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain radiating to back)
- Caution with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 (GLP-1 class warning)
- Monitor glucose closely when used with insulin or sulfonylureas; reduce doses as needed
