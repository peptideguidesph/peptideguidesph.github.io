!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    KPV is a potent anti-inflammatory tripeptide derived from α-MSH that inhibits NF-κB signaling to reduce inflammatory cytokines. Researched for inflammatory bowel disease, skin conditions, and systemic immune modulation with an excellent safety profile.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 200–500 mcg (0.2–0.5 mL at 1 mg/mL)
- **How often:** 1–2 times daily (depending on condition severity)
- **Route:** Injectable — Subcutaneous (abdomen preferred for gut issues; thigh, upper arm)
- **Cycle:** 4–8 weeks
- **Storage:** Refrigerate 2–8°C after reconstitution

## Overview

KPV is a potent anti-inflammatory tripeptide derived from the C-terminal fragment of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). This small peptide exhibits anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties without the pigmentation effects of full α-MSH. KPV has shown promise for inflammatory bowel diseases, skin conditions, and immune modulation through its ability to penetrate cells and interact with inflammatory signaling pathways.

## Key Benefits

- Systemic anti-inflammatory effects
- Immune modulation
- Potential for autoimmune and inflammatory gut/skin conditions

## Mechanism of action

Enters cells and inhibits inflammatory pathways at the nuclear level, particularly NF-κB signaling, reducing transcription of TNF-α, IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines.

## Research indications

- **Inflammation:** Most Effective
- **Gut Health:** Effective
- **Immune Function:** Moderate

## Research protocols

| Goal                      |        Dose | Frequency                          | Route        |
| ------------------------- | ----------: | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| General Anti-Inflammatory | 200–300 mcg | Once daily                         | Subcutaneous |
| Active Inflammation       |     250 mcg | Twice daily                        | Subcutaneous |
| Autoimmune Support        |     500 mcg | Once daily                         | Subcutaneous |
| Acute Flare-ups           |     500 mcg | Twice daily for 1 week then reduce | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** KPV can be dosed flexibly. For gut issues, some prefer morning dosing. For systemic inflammation, split doses may provide better coverage.

!!! danger "Avoid"

    - None documented; standard precautions with immunosuppressive agents apply

## How to reconstitute

1. Clean vial top with alcohol pad
2. Add 1 mL bacteriostatic water to 1 mg vial (creates 1000 mcg/mL)
3. For easier dosing: Add 2 mL to 1 mg vial (creates 500 mcg/mL)
4. Gently swirl to mix - KPV dissolves easily
5. Solution should be clear and colorless
6. Label with concentration and date

**Important:** Always use bacteriostatic water (BAC). Sterile technique is essential.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - High purity (>98%) confirmed by certificate of analysis
    - Clear and colorless solution after reconstitution
    - Proper pH 5.5–7 for optimal stability
    - Small, stable tripeptide structure relative to larger peptides

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Visible cloudiness or particles indicate contamination or degradation — do not use
    - Yellow coloration indicates oxidation and loss of potency — do not use
    - Low purity (<98%) unsuitable for inflammatory condition use

## What to expect

- Day 1–3: Subtle reduction in inflammation, improved energy
- Week 1: Noticeable decrease in inflammatory symptoms
- Week 2–3: Improved gut function, reduced pain/swelling
- Week 4: Significant improvement in target condition
- Week 6–8: Sustained anti-inflammatory benefits, improved quality of life

## Side effects & safety

- Excellent safety profile with minimal side effects
- Does not cause immunosuppression like steroids
- No melanin production or tanning effects
- May temporarily reduce inflammation-related symptoms
- Monitor for signs of infection (rare)
- Generally well-tolerated even at higher doses
