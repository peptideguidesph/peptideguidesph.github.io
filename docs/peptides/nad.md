!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a vital cellular coenzyme declining with age that supports energy production, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation. Injectable forms provide 100% bioavailability for rapid cellular uptake and mitochondrial function optimization.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 100–1000 mg (common clinical ranges shown below)
- **Typical Clinical Dose (quick start):** 250–500 mg
- **How Often:** 1–3× weekly (protocol-dependent)
- **Route:** Injectable (IV, IM, SubQ); oral, topical, and nasal forms also reported
- **Cycle:** 4–12 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is a vital coenzyme found in every cell that plays a crucial role in energy production, DNA repair, and cellular metabolism. As NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, supplementation can support cellular health, boost energy, enhance cognitive function, and promote longevity.

## Key Benefits

- Highest bioavailability (100%) for injectable forms
- Rapid cellular uptake and immediate energy enhancement
- Supports mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation

## Mechanism of action

Direct delivery to the bloodstream ensures maximum cellular availability for energy production, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation.

## Research indications

- **Energy Metabolism (Most Effective):** restores mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis capacity
- **Anti-Aging (Effective):** supports metabolic and cellular maintenance with age-related NAD+ decline
- **Neurological Support (Moderate):** may support cognitive function and recovery

## Research protocols

| Goal                      |        Dose | Frequency   | Route        |
| ------------------------- | ----------: | ----------- | ------------ |
| General Wellness & Energy |  100–250 mg | 1–2× weekly | IV or IM     |
| Anti-Aging Protocol       |  250–500 mg | 2–3× weekly | IV infusion  |
| Cognitive Enhancement     | 500–1000 mg | 1–2× weekly | IV infusion  |
| Athletic Performance      |  250–500 mg | 2× weekly   | IM injection |
| Recovery & Repair         | 500–1000 mg | 3× weekly   | IV infusion  |
| Maintenance Therapy       |  100–250 mg | 1× weekly   | SubQ or IM   |

**Timing:** Morning administration aligns with natural circadian rhythms and provides sustained energy throughout the day.

## Interactions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) — Substrate; synergistic activation
    - AMPK — Complementary pathway activation
    - Pterostilbene/Resveratrol — Compatible; enhance NAD+ benefits
    - B vitamins (niacin precursors) — Compatible
    - Exercise — Synergistic; endogenous NAD+ production increases with activity

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Nicotinamide supplements — Monitor total intake; excess can be hepatotoxic
    - Alcohol — Monitor; alcohol impairs NAD+ metabolism and sirtuin function
    - Antidiabetic medications — Monitor glucose; NAD+ may improve insulin sensitivity

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - High-dose niacin (flushing type) — Avoid concurrent use; overlapping metabolism
    - Excessive alcohol — Avoid; directly reduces NAD+ levels and impairs function

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean work surface and wash hands thoroughly.
2. Wipe tops of both vials with alcohol swabs.
3. Draw appropriate amount of bacteriostatic water (typically 2–3 mL for a 500 mg vial).
4. Inject water slowly into the NAD+ vial, aiming at the glass wall.
5. Gently swirl (do not shake) until completely dissolved — may take 2–3 minutes.
6. Draw the prescribed dose using a fresh needle.
7. Inject at chosen site (IM: deltoid, glute, or thigh; SubQ: abdomen or thigh).
8. Dispose of needles safely and store remaining solution refrigerated; use within 28 days after reconstitution.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Clear, colorless solution with no visible particles
    - Proper refrigeration maintained at 2–8°C for potency
    - Sterile vial with intact seal and batch information
    - Solution used within 28 days of reconstitution with bacteriostatic water
    - Proper storage: protected from light and temperature fluctuations

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Cloudy or discolored solution indicates contamination or degradation — do not use
    - Solution older than 28 days after reconstitution — do not use
    - Vial seal broken or missing batch information
    - Improper storage or temperature excursions
    - Crystallization or particle formation in solution

## What to expect

- Week 1–2: Initial energy improvements and mental clarity
- Week 3–4: Enhanced physical performance and recovery
- Week 5–8: Sustained energy levels and improved sleep quality
- Week 9–12: Optimized metabolic function and cognitive benefits

## Side effects & safety

- Start with lower doses to assess tolerance
- IV administration requires medical supervision
- Monitor for injection site reactions
- Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment
- Maintain consistent dosing schedule for best results
