!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    5-Amino-1MQ is a small-molecule NNMT inhibitor studied for metabolism, weight loss, and longevity. It boosts NAD+ and supports mitochondrial health.

## Overview

### What is 5-Amino-1MQ?

5-Amino-1MQ is a small-molecule inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). It has been shown to increase cellular NAD+ and support mitochondrial performance. Initially examined in metabolic research, it's also being explored for potential benefits in aging and cellular energy regulation.

### Key Benefits

- Improved bioavailability
- Rapid onset of systemic effects
- Supported by experimental research
- Increases NAD+ availability
- Positive impacts on metabolic markers

### Mechanism of Action

When administered by injection, 5-Amino-1MQ reaches the bloodstream directly, inhibiting NNMT and helping raise NAD+ levels to support cellular energy pathways.

## Research Indications

### Metabolism (Most Effective)

- Enhanced NAD+ production
- Support for cellular repair processes
- Improvements in mitochondrial function

### Weight Loss (Effective)

May aid metabolic-driven weight changes via effects on cellular metabolism.

### Longevity (Moderate)

- **NAD+ Enhancement:** Parenteral administration tends to produce larger NAD+ increases and stronger activation of longevity-related pathways
- **Cellular Repair:** Better systemic delivery can support repair and resilience mechanisms
- **Mitochondrial Support:** Direct delivery can promote mitochondrial biogenesis and function

## Research Protocols

| Goal                           | Dose                            | Frequency   | Route       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Conservative starting          | 150–250 mcg                     | Once daily  | SubQ        |
| Conservative standard          | 250–500 mcg                     | Once daily  | SubQ        |
| Conservative moderate          | 500 mcg                         | Once daily  | SubQ        |
| Mouse study (PMC5826726)       | 20 mg/kg TID (60 mg/kg/day)     | 3x daily    | SubQ (mice) |
| Human equivalent (FDA scaling) | ~5 mg/kg/day (~350 mg for 70kg) | Theoretical | Not tested  |

**Timing:** Injections are commonly given in the morning or early afternoon to reduce the chance of sleep disruption. Rotate injection sites to limit local irritation. Effects generally appear faster than with oral dosing.

## Interactions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - NAD+ Precursors (NMN, NR) — complementary; may additively support NAD+ biology.
    - Resveratrol — complementary; possible synergistic metabolic effects.
    - BPC‑157 — compatible; no major interactions reported.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Metformin — combination should be monitored clinically.
    - Berberine — monitor when combined due to metabolic effects.
    - Blood thinners — interaction status unclear; monitor coagulation parameters if combined.

## How to Reconstitute

**Note:** Use bacteriostatic water and maintain sterile technique.

1. Confirm whether you are following an mcg or mg protocol.
2. Wipe vial stopper and add BAC water slowly down the vial wall.
3. Gently swirl until fully dissolved (do not shake).
4. Label the vial with concentration and units (mg/mL).
5. Refrigerate and use within 28 days.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Vial size is appropriate for the chosen protocol (e.g., 5–10 mg for mcg dosing; 50–200 mg for mg dosing).
    - Powder color typically ranges from orange to amber; batch uniformity is desirable.
    - Solution should be clear after reconstitution with no visible particles.
    - Sourced from research‑grade suppliers with documentation (COA preferred).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Clumping or signs of moisture exposure.
    - Persistent cloudiness or particulate matter after reconstitution.

## What to Expect

- **Week 1:** Some users report increased energy (varies by protocol)
- **Weeks 2–3:** Metabolic changes may become apparent, especially with mg dosing
- **Weeks 3–4:** Temporary breathlessness during exercise has been reported by some (adaptation phase)
- **Weeks 4–6:** Dose-dependent changes in body composition may emerge
- **Weeks 6–8:** Effects may plateau; cycling is often recommended
- **Conservative mcg protocols** tend to produce subtler effects
- **mg protocols** are more likely to produce noticeable changes

## Side Effects & Safety

### Side Effects

- Confirm dose units carefully (mcg vs mg difference is 1,000×)
- Begin with lower doses to assess tolerance
- Use sterile injection practices to reduce infection risk
- Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding

### When to Stop

Discontinue use and seek medical advice if significant adverse effects occur.
