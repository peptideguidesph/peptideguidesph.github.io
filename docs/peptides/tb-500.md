!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    TB-500 is a 43-amino acid fragment of thymosin beta-4 with powerful systemic tissue repair, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties; injectable distribution accelerates healing of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and organs while promoting angiogenesis and cell migration.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 2-5mg
- **Frequency:** 2-3x/week
- **Route:** Injectable (SubQ or IM) — belly, thigh, shoulder, or larger muscles
- **Cycle:** 6-8 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** 2-6°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

TB-500 is a synthetic 7-amino acid fragment (Ac-LKKTETQ) corresponding to the active actin-binding region (positions 17-23) of thymosin beta-4. Originally developed for veterinary use in horses, this fragment retains tissue repair and anti-inflammatory properties while being more stable than the full peptide. Banned by WADA for its performance-enhancing effects.

## Key Benefits

- Superior systemic tissue repair
- Accelerated healing of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and organs
- Enhanced cell migration and angiogenesis for regenerative effects

## Mechanism of Action

Injectable TB-500 provides systemic distribution for whole-body tissue repair. Acts on actin dynamics to regulate cell migration, promote angiogenesis, reduce inflammation, and activate stem cell differentiation to accelerate healing.

## Research Protocols

| Goal                    |  Dose | Frequency   | Route                 |
| ----------------------- | ----: | ----------- | --------------------- |
| General tissue repair   | 2-3mg | 2x weekly   | SubQ or IM            |
| Serious injury recovery | 4-5mg | 3x weekly   | SubQ near injury site |
| Athletic enhancement    | 2-3mg | 2x weekly   | SubQ                  |
| Chronic conditions      | 3-4mg | 2-3x weekly | SubQ or IM            |
| Maintenance             |   2mg | 1-2x weekly | SubQ                  |
| Post-surgical recovery  | 3-5mg | 3x weekly   | SubQ                  |

**Timing:** TB-500 timing is flexible and doesn't require an empty stomach. For localized injuries, inject as close to the injury site as possible. For systemic effects, standard subcutaneous injection sites work well.

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean work area and hands thoroughly with alcohol.
2. Calculate required bacteriostatic water (BAC) volume using a calculator.
3. Draw calculated BAC water slowly into syringe.
4. Inject BAC water slowly down the side of the vial (never directly onto the powder).
5. Gently swirl vial until powder completely dissolves (never shake vigorously).
6. Store reconstituted solution in refrigerator and use within 28 days.

**Important:** Always use bacteriostatic water (BAC). Sterile technique is essential.
