**Tags:** Weight Loss, Diabetes, GLP-1

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    Semaglutide is a long‑acting GLP‑1 receptor agonist with robust evidence for weight loss and glycemic control; once-weekly dosing improves adherence.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 0.25–2.4 mg weekly (titrated)
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injectable (abdomen, thigh, upper arm)
- **Cycle:** Ongoing as prescribed (titrate to target dose)
- **Storage:** Refrigerate 2–8°C before use; some products stable at room temp for limited periods

## Overview

Semaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and chronic weight management (Wegovy). Extensive clinical trials demonstrate significant weight loss and improved glycemic control via appetite suppression, slowed gastric emptying, and enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion.

## Key Benefits

- Clinically proven weight loss (average 15–20% in trials at 2.4 mg)
- Improved glycemic control for type 2 diabetes
- Once-weekly dosing for convenience
- Cardiovascular outcome benefits in high-risk populations

## Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide binds GLP-1 receptors, augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing appetite via central pathways. A long half-life (approx. 7 days) enables weekly dosing.

## Research Protocols

| Goal                      |        Dose | Frequency                        | Route        |
| ------------------------- | ----------: | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Weight Loss Initiation    |     0.25 mg | Weekly x 4 weeks, then increase  | Subcutaneous |
| Weight Loss Maintenance   |      2.4 mg | Weekly (after 16-week titration) | Subcutaneous |
| Diabetes Management       |    0.5–1 mg | Weekly                           | Subcutaneous |
| Cardiovascular Protection |    0.5–1 mg | Weekly                           | Subcutaneous |
| Tolerability-Based        | 0.25–2.4 mg | Weekly (individualized)          | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Inject on the same day each week. If a dose is missed and within 5 days, take it; otherwise skip and resume the regular schedule.

## How to Reconstitute / Inject

1. For pre-filled pens, attach a new needle and prime per instructions.
2. For vials, draw prescribed dose with appropriate syringe.
3. Clean injection site with alcohol and allow to dry.
4. Inject subcutaneously at 90° (or 45° if lean).
5. Hold for ~6 seconds after injection to ensure full dose delivery.
6. Dispose of needles safely and rotate injection sites weekly.

## Peptide Interactions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Tirzepatide — avoid combination due to overlapping incretin effects and hypoglycemia risk.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Insulin — monitor and adjust doses to avoid hypoglycemia.
    - Sulfonylureas — monitor for hypoglycemia when combined.
    - Oral medications — timing may be required due to slowed gastric emptying.

!!! info "Compatible / Synergistic"

    - Cagrilintide — synergistic in combination protocols (clinical monitoring advised).
    - Metformin — compatible and commonly co‑prescribed.
    - Growth Hormone Peptides / BPC‑157 — generally compatible.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - FDA‑approved branded products (Ozempic, Wegovy) from licensed pharmacies
    - Proper storage verification and clear solution after reconstitution
    - Stable packaging and visible batch/lot information

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Cloudy, discolored, or particulate solutions — do not use
    - Compounded/non‑pharmacy sources without COA — avoid when possible
    - Improper storage temperatures or damaged seals

## What to Expect

- Week 1–4: Mild appetite reduction, possible nausea during titration
- Month 2–3: Noticeable weight loss (5–10% typical), improved satiety
- Month 4–6: Continued weight loss (10–15% common), stable glucose
- Month 6+: Possible plateau; maintenance with continued therapy
- Diabetes benefits may appear within 1–2 weeks

## Side Effects & Safety

- Common: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation
- Start low and titrate to minimize GI side effects
- Contraindicated with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN 2
- Monitor for pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain)
- Not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding
