# GHK-Cu (Topical)

**Tags:** GHK-Cu, Copper Peptide, Topical, Skin Regeneration

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    GHK-Cu topical formulations deliver a naturally occurring copper tripeptide to skin for collagen synthesis, wound healing, and anti-aging effects. Clinical evidence supports efficacy in skin regeneration and hair growth stimulation.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Concentration:** 0.5–2% (0.5–1% common)
- **Route:** Topical — face, neck, scalp
- **Cycle:** 12–16 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** Room temperature; cool, dry place

## Overview

GHK‑Cu is a naturally occurring copper tripeptide found in human plasma, saliva, and urine. Plasma levels decline from ~200 ng/ml at age 20 to ~80 ng/ml by age 60. Research shows it affects 31.2% of human genes and promotes wound healing, collagen synthesis, and anti‑aging effects. Topical formulations deliver copper directly to the skin for local regenerative effects; most clinical evidence for topical use is from in vitro and human skin studies.

## Key Benefits

- Enhanced collagen and elastin production
- Improved skin elasticity and texture; reduced fine lines
- Accelerated wound healing and barrier restoration
- Hair growth stimulation when applied to scalp

## Mechanism of action

Topical GHK‑Cu penetrates skin layers to deliver copper to target tissues, activating fibroblasts, stimulating collagen and elastin synthesis, promoting angiogenesis, and modulating inflammatory responses for skin regeneration.

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 404.96 Da
- **Length:** 3 amino acids
- **Type:** Copper tripeptide

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

```
Gly-His-Lys
```

_Complexed with copper (Cu2+) for enhanced bioavailability._

## Research indications

- Skin regeneration and anti‑aging
- Hair growth stimulation
- Wound healing and barrier repair
- General skin health and hydration

## Research protocols

| Goal                    | Dose / Concentration | Frequency  | Route                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------: | :--------: | -------------------- |
| Anti‑aging skincare     |   0.5–1% cream/serum | 1–2× daily | Topical (face, neck) |
| Hair growth stimulation |        1–2% solution |  1× daily  | Scalp massage        |
| Wound healing           |             1–2% gel | 2–3× daily | Direct application   |
| General skin health     |           0.5% serum |  1× daily  | Face and neck        |
| Intensive repair        |             2% cream |  1× daily  | Targeted areas       |

**Timing:** Apply to clean, dry skin. Morning use requires sunscreen; evening application supports overnight repair. Start once daily to assess tolerance.

!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Copper supplements (systemic) — May increase toxicity risk when topical use is widespread

## How to apply

1. Cleanse skin thoroughly with a gentle cleanser.
2. Pat skin dry and wait ~5 minutes.
3. Apply a thin, even layer of GHK‑Cu product to target areas.
4. Massage gently until fully absorbed (1–2 minutes).
5. Follow with moisturizer if using a serum; apply sunscreen during daytime use.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Light blue tint (characteristic from copper content)
    - Smooth, non-gritty texture that absorbs without residue
    - Stable formulation with no separation or crystallization
    - Professional packaging (UV protection, airless pumps, dark glass)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Green/dark discoloration or grainy texture — do not use

## What to expect

- Week 1–2: Improved texture and hydration
- Week 3–4: Reduction in fine lines and increased smoothness
- Week 6–8: Improved firmness and elasticity
- Week 8–12+: Visible improvements in tone and clarity; hair growth 6–12 weeks for initial signs

## Side effects & safety

- Patch test before first use to check for sensitivity
- May cause mild, transient irritation initially
- Use sunscreen with daytime application (photosensitivity risk)
- Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes
- Discontinue if severe irritation or allergic reaction occurs
