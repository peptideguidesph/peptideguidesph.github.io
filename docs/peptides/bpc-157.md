## Quick Facts

**Tags:** Tissue Repair, Tendon Healing, Angiogenesis, GI Protection

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    BPC-157 is a 15‑amino‑acid peptide studied for accelerated tissue repair, angiogenesis, and gastrointestinal protection; widely used experimentally for tendon and muscle healing.

- **Typical Dose:** 250–500 mcg (inj.) — up to 1,000 mcg for serious injury
- **Frequency:** 1–2× daily
- **Route:** Subcutaneous (near injury), intramuscular or oral formulations exist
- **Cycle:** 4–8 weeks common; maintenance dosing possible
- **Storage:** Refrigerate 2–6°C; reconstituted solution usable for ~28 days

## Overview

BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound‑157) is a synthetic 15‑amino‑acid peptide derived from a naturally occurring gastric protein. It is widely studied for accelerating tissue repair, reducing inflammation, and protecting the gastrointestinal tract. BPC‑157 is not FDA‑approved and was added to WADA's prohibited list (S0) in 2022.

## Key Benefits

- Speeds healing of tendons, ligaments, muscle and bone
- Enhances local tissue repair and angiogenesis
- Anti‑inflammatory and protective effects in gastrointestinal models

## Mechanism of Action

Injected BPC‑157 concentrates at target tissues and appears to promote angiogenesis, stimulate collagen formation, modulate growth factor signaling, and protect against various forms of tissue damage.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 1,419.53 Da
- **Length:** 15 amino acids
- **Type:** Pentadecapeptide
- **Sequence:** Gly‑Lys‑Pro‑Pro‑Pro‑Gly‑Lys‑Pro‑Ala‑Asp‑Asp‑Ala‑Gly‑Leu‑Val

## Research Indications

- **Wound & Tendon Healing (Most Effective):** Strong preclinical support for accelerated tendon‑to‑bone integration and improved biomechanical strength after injury.
- **Muscle Recovery (Effective):** Demonstrated faster muscle repair and improved histology in injury models.
- **Angiogenesis & Vascularization:** Promotes new blood vessel formation in healing tissues.
- **Neurological & GI (Moderate):** Emerging evidence for neuroprotective effects and gastrointestinal protection in experimental work.

## Research Protocols

| Goal                 |          Dose | Frequency  | Route            |
| -------------------- | ------------: | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Tendon/Joint healing |   250–500 mcg | 1–2× daily | SubQ near injury |
| Serious injury       | 500–1,000 mcg | 2× daily   | SubQ near injury |
| General healing      |   250–500 mcg | 1–2× daily | SubQ or IM       |
| Maintenance          |       250 mcg | 1× daily   | SubQ             |

**Timing:** Injectable BPC‑157 is often used on an empty stomach for systemic effects and injected close to the injury site for localized healing. Rotate injection sites to avoid irritation.

!!! danger "Avoid"

    - No specific avoidances reported; follow clinical guidance

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean work area and hands.
2. Calculate required bacteriostatic water (BAC) volume.
3. Draw BAC into a syringe and inject slowly down vial side.
4. Gently swirl to dissolve; do not shake.
5. Refrigerate and use within ~28 days.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Lyophilized powder appears as a white, fluffy cake
    - Properly reconstituted solution is clear with no persistent particles
    - Small clumping that dissolves with gentle swirling is acceptable

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Collapsed or melted powder (heat exposure)
    - Persistent particles or cloudy solution after reconstitution

## What to Expect

- Week 1–2: Reduced local inflammation and decreased pain at the injection site
- Week 2–4: Faster healing progress and improved tissue repair markers
- Week 4–8: Peak localized healing benefits for tendon/ligament/muscle injuries

## Side Effects & Safety

- Generally well tolerated with minimal systemic adverse effects reported in preclinical and user reports
- Possible mild injection‑site redness or irritation
- Use sterile injection technique; consult a physician if on anticoagulants due to pro‑angiogenic effects
- Not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding; WADA‑prohibited for athletes
