!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
      AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone that selectively promotes fat breakdown without raising IGF-1 or impairing glucose metabolism.

## Overview

### What is AOD-9604?

AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone (hGH 176–191) with an added N‑terminal tyrosine. The 17‑amino‑acid peptide promotes fat breakdown (lipolysis) and reduces fat formation (lipogenesis) while lacking the growth-promoting actions of full-length hGH — it does not raise IGF‑1, alter glucose handling, or bind the GH receptor.

### Key Benefits

- Encourages fat loss by increasing fat oxidation and plasma glycerol
- Does not raise IGF‑1 or impair glucose metabolism like intact hGH
- Shows potential for supporting cartilage repair and joint health

### Mechanism of Action

AOD‑9604 appears to stimulate lipolysis and suppress lipogenesis largely via upregulation of β3‑adrenergic pathways, while avoiding direct GH receptor activation. This selective profile supports fat‑specific effects without the systemic metabolic effects seen with full growth hormone.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 1,815.1 Da
- **Length:** 17 amino acids
- **Type:** Modified hGH C‑terminal fragment

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

`YLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF` (Tyr‑Leu‑Arg‑Ile‑Val‑Gln‑Cys‑Arg‑Ser‑Val‑Glu‑Gly‑Ser‑Cys‑Gly‑Phe)

_This is hGH fragment 176–191 with an added N‑terminal tyrosine and a disulfide between Cys183 and Cys189._

## Research Indications

- **Fat Loss (Most Effective):** Increases fat oxidation, raises plasma glycerol, and reduces body weight in obese models without negatively impacting glucose regulation.
- **Lipogenesis Inhibition:** Lowers fat synthesis and storage in adipose tissue; effects observed in animal studies and isolated human adipose samples.
- **Metabolic Safety:** Unlike full hGH, AOD‑9604 does not produce hyperglycemia, reduce insulin secretion, or increase insulin resistance.
- **Joint Support (Effective):** Shows promise for cartilage and joint-related benefits in some reports.

## Research Protocols

| Goal               | Dose        | Frequency  | Route        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Fat loss           | 250–300 mcg | Once daily | Subcutaneous |
| Enhanced fat loss  | 400–500 mcg | Once daily | Subcutaneous |
| Joint support      | 250 mcg     | Once daily | Subcutaneous |
| Conservative start | 200 mcg     | Once daily | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Administer in the morning on an empty stomach and wait ~30 minutes before eating. Some protocols target abdominal subcutaneous injections for potential localized effect.

!!! danger "Avoid"

      - No specific avoidances reported for AOD-9604 in the literature; follow clinical guidance.

## How to Reconstitute

**Important:** Use bacteriostatic water (BAC) and sterile technique.

1. Let the vial warm to room temperature (15–20°C)
2. Calculate BAC water volume using a calculator
3. Draw BAC water into a syringe
4. Add water slowly down the vial wall (avoid splashing onto powder)
5. Gently swirl until fully dissolved (do not shake)
6. Store reconstituted solution at 2–8°C and use within 28 days

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

      - White to off‑white lyophilized powder or cake (uniform appearance)
      - Clear solution after reconstitution with no visible particles
      - Certificate of Analysis showing ≥98% purity by HPLC and confirmed sequence

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

      - Discolored, yellowed, or clumped powder
      - Cloudy or particulate solution after reconstitution
      - Note: AOD‑9604 is not FDA‑approved as a therapeutic drug (GRAS status for food use only)
      - Banned by WADA — prohibited for athletes

## What to Expect

- **Weeks 1–2:** Little noticeable effect as the compound accumulates
- **Weeks 3–4:** Subtle body composition changes may appear
- **Weeks 5–8:** More evident fat loss when combined with diet and exercise
- **Weeks 8–12:** Continued reduction in fat and improved composition; results vary by protocol
- **Side effects:** Generally well tolerated; mild injection site reactions possible

## Side Effects & Safety

- Generally well tolerated in clinical and preclinical studies
- Does not appear to affect blood glucose or insulin in the way full hGH can
- Does not increase IGF‑1
- May cause mild injection site irritation
- Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding
- WADA‑prohibited — not for competitive athletes
