# Tirzepatide

**Tags:** Weight Loss, Diabetes, Metabolic Health

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
	Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist with powerful weight-loss and glycemic benefits demonstrated in large Phase 3 trials.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 2.5-15mg weekly
- **Frequency:** Once weekly
- **Route:** Injectable → Thigh, abdomen (2+ inches from navel), upper arm
- **Cycle:** 12-24+ weeks (typical duration)
- **Storage:** 2-8°C (Refrigerated)

## Overview

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. FDA-approved for both type 2 diabetes management and chronic weight management, it has demonstrated unprecedented efficacy for weight loss and metabolic health optimization. Tirzepatide mimics incretin hormones that regulate blood sugar, slow gastric emptying, and reduce appetite, offering superior results compared to single-mechanism GLP-1 agonists.

## Key Benefits

- Dramatic weight loss (15-22% body weight)
- Superior diabetes control and HbA1c reduction
- Reduced cardiovascular risk markers
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Appetite suppression with preserved lean mass when combined with resistance training

## Mechanism of Action

Dual agonist of GIP and GLP-1 receptors → glucose-dependent insulin stimulation, delayed gastric emptying, glucagon suppression, and central satiety signaling.

## Research Protocols

| Goal                         |             Dose |   Frequency | Route          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------: | ----------: | -------------- |
| Weight loss initiation       |     2.5mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Weight loss progression      |       5mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Weight loss optimization     |  7.5-10mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Maximum weight loss          | 12.5-15mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Diabetes management (mild)   |   5-7.5mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |
| Diabetes management (severe) |   10-15mg weekly | Once weekly | SubQ injection |

**Timing:** Tirzepatide can be injected at any time of day, with or without food. Choose a consistent day of the week for weekly injections to maintain steady levels.

## How to Reconstitute

1. Remove tirzepatide vial from refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature for 15–20 minutes to prevent condensation.
2. Clean vial tops with alcohol wipes using circular motion from center outward; allow to air dry completely.
3. Calculate appropriate reconstitution volume based on desired concentration using a calculator.
4. Draw calculated amount of bacteriostatic water into an insulin syringe, ensuring no air bubbles.
5. Insert needle at a 45° angle against the glass wall and inject slowly down the side of the vial.
6. Gently swirl until fully dissolved — AVOID shaking vigorously.
7. Allow solution to settle; persistent cloudiness indicates degradation — discard if present.
8. Label vial with reconstitution date and concentration; store refrigerated at 2–8°C and use within 28 days.

## Peptide Interactions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Semaglutide → overlapping GLP‑1 activity and increased hypoglycemia risk when combined.
    - Liraglutide → similar GLP‑1 mechanism; avoid combination except under specialist supervision.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Insulin → adjust and monitor dose closely to avoid hypoglycemia as glycemic control improves.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info "Compatible / Synergistic"

    - Metformin → synergistic; commonly co‑prescribed to support glycemic control.
    - CJC‑1295 → compatible; monitor clinically for hormone effects.
    - Ipamorelin → compatible; generally safe to combine.
    - BPC‑157 → compatible; tissue‑repair peptide with no major reported interactions.
    - 5‑Amino‑1MQ → compatible; monitor overall metabolic regimen.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White to off‑white lyophilized powder (light, fluffy cake without clumping)
    - Clear reconstituted solution (no particles or cloudiness)
    - Intact vial seal and proper labeling (batch numbers, expiration)
    - Proper storage maintenance (2–8°C, protected from light)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Clumping, discoloration, or moisture indicates damage
    - Persistent cloudiness after reconstitution indicates aggregation or contamination
    - Unusual crystallization patterns may indicate temperature fluctuation or degradation

## What to Expect

- Appetite reduction within 1-3 days of first injection
- Mild to moderate nausea for first 2-4 weeks (typically improves)
- 1-3 lbs weight loss per week during active weight-loss phase
- Improved blood sugar control within 1-2 weeks for diabetics
- Reduced food cravings and smaller portion satisfaction
- Better satiety lasting 6-7 days per injection
- Possible fatigue during initial adaptation weeks
- Peak weight loss effects typically seen at 16-24 weeks

## Side Effects & Safety

- Start with the lowest dose (2.5mg) and escalate every 4 weeks to minimize side effects
- Contraindicated with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2
- Monitor for signs of acute pancreatitis (severe, persistent abdominal pain radiating to the back)
- Significant nausea is common initially → stay hydrated and eat smaller meals
- Requires prescription and medical supervision → not available over-the-counter
- Store refrigerated 2-8°C; never freeze or shake vigorously
- May require adjustment of other diabetes medications to prevent hypoglycemia
