!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Melanotan I is a synthetic α-MSH analog that selectively targets MC1 receptors to stimulate melanin production. Injectable form requires 2–3× daily dosing due to short half-life; induces rapid tanning effects with potential photoprotection from increased melanin density.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 0.5–1 mg total (2–3× daily during loading)
- **Route:** Injectable — SubQ: abdomen, thigh, upper arm (rotate sites)
- **Cycle:** 2–4 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Melanotan I (afamelanotide) is a synthetic analog of α‑melanocyte stimulating hormone that selectively targets MC1 receptors to stimulate melanin production. While an FDA‑approved implant version (SCENESSE®) exists for rare medical conditions, research‑grade injectable Melanotan I is studied for its photoprotective and tanning effects through regular subcutaneous administration.

## Key Benefits

- Precise dosing control and rapid onset of tanning effects compared with implants
- Visible tanning within 1–2 weeks with appropriate UV exposure
- Potential photoprotection via increased melanin density

## Mechanism of action

Subcutaneous injection delivers Melanotan I into systemic circulation with high bioavailability. Short plasma half‑life (~30 minutes) requires multiple daily injections for sustained MC1R activation and melanin production.

## Research indications

- Enhanced tanning response (deeper, longer‑lasting tan)
- Photoprotection (reduced sunburn susceptibility)
- More even pigmentation and reduced patchy tanning

## Research protocols

| Goal                         |    Dose | Frequency | Route                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------: | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Initial Tanning (Light Skin) | 0.25 mg | 2× daily  | Subcutaneous injection |
| Maintenance Tanning          |  0.5 mg | 1× daily  | Subcutaneous injection |
| Enhanced Pigmentation        |  0.5 mg | 2× daily  | Subcutaneous injection |
| Photoprotection Only         | 0.25 mg | 1× daily  | Subcutaneous injection |

**Timing:** Multiple daily injections are typically needed due to the ~30‑minute half‑life. Best results when combined with minimal UV exposure 2–3 hours after injection.

!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Tretinoin/Retinoids — Monitor combination; assess skin tolerance
    - Photosensitizing medications — Use caution; may increase photosensitivity

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Excessive UV exposure — Risk of skin damage; photoprotection is not equivalent to sun protection factor (SPF)

## How to reconstitute

1. Allow peptide vial and BAC water to reach room temperature.
2. Swab tops of both vials with alcohol and allow to dry.
3. Draw appropriate volume of bacteriostatic water into a syringe.
4. Inject BAC slowly down the side of the peptide vial to avoid foaming.
5. Gently swirl (do not shake) until powder completely dissolves.
6. Confirm solution is clear and colorless.
7. Draw desired dose with a fresh insulin syringe.
8. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated at 2–8°C for up to 4 weeks.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Third-party laboratory testing (HPLC, amino acid analysis) with >98% purity when available
    - Lyophilized powder stable during shipping; refrigerated upon arrival
    - Clear, colorless solution after reconstitution with no visible particles
    - Proper storage history and temperature control maintained

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Premixed solutions available — Avoid; peptides degrade rapidly in solution without preservation
    - No third-party testing or purity documentation provided
    - Cloudiness or visible particles in reconstituted solution — do not use
    - Improper storage or freeze–thaw cycles — quality compromised

## What to expect

- Days 1–3: Possible mild nausea, facial flushing, reduced appetite
- Days 3–7: Initial skin darkening, increased pigmentation of moles and freckles
- Week 1–2: Noticeable tanning with minimal UV exposure
- Week 2–4: Peak tanning effects; maintenance may require reduced injection frequency

## Side effects & safety

- Research peptide — sold for research purposes only; not approved for general human use
- Start with lower doses to assess tolerance
- Monitor moles and skin changes; perform regular self‑examinations
- Use sterile injection technique to prevent infection
- Maintain UV protection despite enhanced tanning — risk of overexposure remains
