!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    Selank is a synthetic heptapeptide analog of tuftsin with anxiolytic and nootropic properties; rapid nasal delivery provides fast-acting anxiety relief and cognitive enhancement without benzodiazepine side effects.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 600-900mcg daily (300mcg per spray) 1-3 sprays daily
- **Route:** Nasal (intranasal spray alternate nostrils)
- **Cycle:** 2-8 weeks (typical duration)
- **Storage:** 2-8C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Selank is a synthetic heptapeptide analog of the naturally occurring immune peptide tuftsin, developed by the Russian Academy of Sciences. This anxiolytic and nootropic peptide has been extensively studied for its ability to reduce anxiety, enhance cognitive function, and modulate immune responses without the side effects associated with traditional benzodiazepines. Selank works through complex interactions with GABAergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, offering a unique mechanism for stress reduction and cognitive enhancement.

## Key Benefits

- Fastest onset anxiolytic effects
- Enhanced nootropic activity
- Direct nose-to-brain delivery
- No injection required
- Convenient administration

## Mechanism of Action

- Direct nose-to-brain transport via olfactory pathways
- Increased NMDA binding sites (noted with nasal delivery)
- Rapid passage through nasal mucosa with enhanced cognitive effects

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 751.89 Da
- **Length:** 7 amino acids
- **Type:** Tuftsin analog

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

```
Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro

| Goal                               |                               Dose | Frequency                          | Route      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------: | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Mild anxiety/cognitive enhancement |                   300mcg (1 spray) | Once daily                         | Intranasal |
| Moderate anxiety relief            | 600mcg (2 sprays or 1 per nostril) | Once daily                         | Intranasal |
| Intensive anxiety/GAD treatment    |                  900mcg (3 sprays) | Once daily or divided              | Intranasal |
| As-needed anxiety relief           |                         300-600mcg | As needed (max 3x daily)           | Intranasal |
| Cognitive enhancement before tasks |                             300mcg | 30-60 min before cognitive demands | Intranasal |
| PTSD/trauma episode management     |                         300-600mcg | During acute episodes              | Intranasal |

**Timing:** Nasal Selank works fastest when administered on empty nasal passages. Morning use provides cognitive benefits, while as-needed use offers rapid anxiety relief.

## How to Reconstitute / Use (Nasal spray guidance)

1. Ensure nasal spray is at room temperature (remove from fridge 10-15 minutes before use).
2. Clear nasal passages gently do not use if congested or actively sick.
3. Prime pump if first use by spraying 1-2 times into air until fine mist appears.
4. Tilt head slightly forward and insert spray tip into one nostril.
5. Close opposite nostril with finger and breathe gently through open nostril.
6. Depress pump fully while inhaling slowly and steadily.
7. Remove spray tip and breathe gently through nose to distribute peptide.
8. If using multiple sprays, alternate nostrils and wait 30 seconds between sprays.
9. Wipe spray tip clean and store in refrigerator immediately after use.
10. Track doses and monitor for changes in anxiety or cognitive function.

## Quality Indicators

!!! success - Clear, colorless nasal spray with no particles, cloudiness, or discoloration - Proper concentration labeling (typically 300mcg per spray) with batch testing and expiration dates - Appropriate packaging and storage; lyophilized powder can ship at room temperature; refrigerate upon arrival for long-term storage - Functioning spray mechanism; pump should produce fine, consistent mist without clogging

!!! danger - Cloudy, discolored, or particles present - Strong odor or burning sensation - Room temperature shipping reduces potency

## What to Expect

- Onset of effects within 15-30 minutes of administration.
- Enhanced cognitive clarity and focus within first hour.
- Anxiety reduction without sedation or cognitive impairment.
- Effects typically last 4-6 hours (shorter than injection).
- Enhanced nootropic benefits compared to injection route.
- Possible mild nasal irritation initially.
- Faster tolerance development possible due to rapid clearance.

## Side Effects & Safety

- Use only high-quality, properly stored nasal spray formulations.
- Do not use if nasal passages are congested or during active illness.
- Monitor for nasal irritation or dryness with prolonged use.
- Nasal route allows for more frequent dosing if needed.
- Store in refrigerator and use within 30 days of opening.
- Prime pump before first use to ensure accurate dosing.
- Consult healthcare provider for combining with nasal medications.
