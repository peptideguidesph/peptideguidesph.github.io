# CJC/IPA Protocol

**Tags:** CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Protocol, Growth Hormone

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    The CJC/IPA protocol combines CJC-1295 (DAC-modified GHRH analogue) with Ipamorelin (selective GHS) to optimize GH via complementary mechanisms: sustained baseline elevation plus short GH pulses.

## Overview

The CJC/IPA protocol pairs a long-acting GHRH analogue with a selective GH secretagogue to target recovery, lean mass, and sleep quality; clinical combination trials are limited.

## Key Benefits

- Dual-pathway GH optimization: sustained baseline elevation plus selective pulses
- Improved recovery and protein synthesis support for training
- Potential lean-mass preservation during calorie deficit and aging

## Mechanism of Action

- CJC-1295 (DAC) extends circulation via albumin binding, prolonging GHRH receptor stimulation.
- Ipamorelin activates ghrelin receptors (GHSR1a) to induce GH release without notable ACTH/cortisol effects.

## Research Indications

- Muscle growth and performance
- Recovery optimization after training
- Metabolic health and lean-mass preservation
- Moderate anti-aging support via IGF-1 optimization

## Research Protocols

| Goal                        |                              Dose | Frequency   | Route        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------: | ----------- | ------------ |
| General health optimization |  200 mcg each (0.2 mL if 1 mg/mL) | Once daily  | Subcutaneous |
| Performance enhancement     | 250 mcg each (0.25 mL if 1 mg/mL) | Once daily  | Subcutaneous |
| Recovery optimization       |  300 mcg each (0.3 mL if 1 mg/mL) | Once daily  | Subcutaneous |
| Conservative approach       | 150 mcg each (0.15 mL if 1 mg/mL) | 5 days/week | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** CJC-1295 has a 6–8 day half-life (sustained effects). Ipamorelin has a ~2-hour half-life for immediate GH pulses. Evening dosing (30–60 minutes before bed) aligns with circadian GH peaks and is commonly recommended.

!!! warning "Monitor"

    - MK-677 — Monitor combination
    - Insulin — Monitor combination (GH affects insulin sensitivity)
    - Thyroid medications — Requires timing adjustments

!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Synthetic HGH — Avoid combination
    - Corticosteroids — Use caution

## How to Reconstitute

1. Blended vials: add 2 mL bacteriostatic water to create ~2 mg/mL (1 mg/mL each peptide).
2. Separate vials: add 2 mL bacteriostatic water to each vial (1 mg/mL each).
3. Blended dosing: draw 0.2–0.3 mL for a 200–300 mcg dose of each peptide in a single injection.
4. Separate dosing: mix equal volumes in one syringe or inject at different sites.
5. Inject 2–3 hours after last meal and 30–60 minutes before bed when practical.
6. Rotate subcutaneous sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm) to prevent tissue issues.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Standard labeling often lists total mg and per-peptide amounts (e.g., "10 mg total: 5 mg CJC-1295 + 5 mg Ipamorelin").
    - Beginners: separate vials allow individual tolerance testing; experienced users may prefer blended formulations for convenience.
    - Maintain approximately 1:1 ratio of peptides for complementary effects.
    - Reconstitution should yield a clear solution without particles or precipitation.
    - Request a Certificate of Analysis (COA) showing individual peptide purities for blends.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Cloudy solution, particulates, or missing COA

## What to Expect

- Week 1–2: improved sleep depth and vivid dreams for some users
- Week 3–4: enhanced exercise recovery and reduced soreness
- Week 6–8: gradual body-composition improvements and skin quality changes
- Week 8–12: optimized benefits if protocol is effective; individual responses vary
- Post-cycle: some benefits may persist for several weeks due to improved recovery and sleep

## Side Effects & Safety

- CRITICAL: test individual peptides separately before combining when possible
- No clinical trials validate combination benefits or long-term safety vs. individual peptides
- Use pharmaceutical-grade peptides with COA
- Monitor blood glucose in people with diabetes (GH affects insulin sensitivity)
- Start conservative (200 mcg each) to assess tolerance; discontinue if adverse reactions occur
- Maintain injection-site rotation and regular bloodwork (IGF-1 monitoring) for extended use
