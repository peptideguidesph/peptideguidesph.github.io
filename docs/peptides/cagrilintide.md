!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    Cagrilintide is a long-acting lipidated amylin analogue shown to produce substantial weight loss, especially when combined with semaglutide (CagriSema); weekly subcutaneous dosing.

## Overview

Cagrilintide (AM833) is a long-acting, lipidated amylin analogue that activates amylin and calcitonin receptors. It was developed for weight management and type 2 diabetes, and clinical data show substantial weight loss — especially when combined with semaglutide (the combination is often referred to as "CagriSema"). Recent Phase 3 results report up to ~22.7% mean weight reduction in combination therapy.

## Key Benefits

- Once-weekly dosing (convenient maintenance)
- Demonstrated large weight-loss efficacy in Phase 3 when combined with semaglutide
- Designed for sustained weight maintenance and metabolic benefits in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes

## Mechanism of Action

As a lipidated amylin analogue, cagrilintide targets both amylin and calcitonin receptors to increase satiety and modulate metabolic pathways. Lipidation extends circulation time, allowing weekly subcutaneous dosing.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 4,409.01 Da
- **Length:** 37 amino acids
- **Type:** Amylin receptor agonist (lipidated)

## Research Indications

- Weight loss (most effective; particularly when used with semaglutide)
- Type 2 diabetes with associated weight reduction and improved glycemic control
- Sustained weight maintenance during continued therapy

| Type 2 Diabetes Management                 |                          2.4 mg | Once weekly                    | Subcutaneous injection (often with metformin) |
| Dose Escalation                            | 0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 → 1.7 → 2.4 mg | Weekly increases over 16 weeks | Subcutaneous injection                        |
| Combination Diabetes Therapy               |        2.4 mg + SGLT2 inhibitor | Once weekly                    | Subcutaneous injection                        |
| Cardiovascular Risk Reduction (REDEFINE 3) |                          2.4 mg | Once weekly                    | Subcutaneous injection                        |

**Timing:** administer on the same day each week; evening dosing may reduce morning nausea. Because the route is subcutaneous, it can be given with or without food.

## How to Reconstitute (practical notes)

1. Cagrilintide formulations require an acidic pH (optimal ~3.5–4.5) to avoid fibril formation. Standard bacteriostatic water (pH ~5.5–6) is acceptable for short-term refrigerated use (<30 days), but acidification to ~pH 4.0 (for long-term stability) is recommended in research settings.
2. Reconstitute slowly down the vial wall and gently swirl — do not shake.
3. Verify pH after reconstitution (3.5–4.5) and ensure the solution is clear; discard if cloudy or if particles are visible.
4. Store frozen at -20°C and refrigerate after thawing; inspect for clarity before each injection.
5. Allow the vial to warm to room temperature for 15–30 minutes before injection and rotate subcutaneous injection sites weekly.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Pre-filled pen design likely for commercial formulation (post-approval)
    - Clinical-grade material shows >98% purity with correct lipidation and folding
    - Stable pharmacokinetics support 7-day dosing intervals when stored and handled properly

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Amylin analogs can form amyloid fibrils at neutral/alkaline pH; maintain acidic conditions to prevent aggregation

## What to Expect (timeline)

- Week 1–2: GI adaptation, mild nausea possible during dose escalation
- Week 4–8: Early weight loss (approx. 2–5%), reduced appetite
- Week 12–26: Accelerated weight loss (≈10–15%), improved satiety
- Week 26+: Peak efficacy (≈15–23% weight loss when combined with semaglutide), sustained with ongoing therapy

## Side Effects & Safety

- Most common: gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during early treatment
- Anti-cagrilintide antibodies are frequently seen (46–73%) but have not been shown to affect efficacy in trials
- No clinically meaningful QT prolongation observed in thorough QT assessments
- Not all patients reach the 2.4 mg target dose (REDEFINE 1 achieved 2.4 mg in ~57.3% of participants)
- Maintain acidic formulation to avoid fibril formation and deamidation; inspect reconstituted solutions before use
