# Semax

**Tags:** Nootropic, Neuroprotective, Cognitive Enhancement

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"
    Semax is a synthetic heptapeptide derived from ACTH with powerful nootropic, neuroprotective, and memory-enhancing effects; rapid nasal delivery increases BDNF and enhances cognitive function via dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 300–1000mcg (1–3 times daily)
- **Route:** Nasal (intranasal spray/drops)
- **Cycle:** 2–4 weeks on, 1–2 weeks off
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Semax is a synthetic heptapeptide derived from adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) fragment 4–10, extensively studied for its nootropic, neuroprotective, and neurorestorative properties. Originally developed for stroke recovery, it rapidly increases BDNF levels and modulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems to enhance cognitive function, memory, and focus.

## Key Benefits

- Rapid brain delivery
- Extensive clinical research
- Easy self-administration (nasal)
- Good CNS bioavailability

## Mechanism of Action

Semax is transported via the olfactory epithelium and trigeminal pathways, bypassing the blood–brain barrier to enhance central nervous system penetration and modulate neurotrophic and neurotransmitter systems.

## Research Protocols

| Goal                                   |        Dose | Frequency                            | Route                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------: | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Cognitive enhancement (healthy adults) |  300–600mcg | 1–2 times daily                      | Intranasal spray/drops                  |
| Learning and memory support            |  600–900mcg | 2–3 times daily during study periods | Intranasal spray/drops                  |
| Recovery from brain injury             | 900–1500mcg | 2–3 times daily                      | Intranasal drops (clinical supervision) |
| Anti-fatigue cognitive support         |  400–800mcg | Single morning dose                  | Intranasal spray                        |
| Research/experimental protocols        | 250–1000mcg | Variable based on study design       | Standardized intranasal delivery        |

**Timing:** Morning administration optimizes cognitive benefits throughout the day while avoiding evening alertness that could impact sleep.

## How to Reconstitute / Use (Nasal)

1. Semax nasal formulations often come pre-mixed as 0.1% or 1% solutions.
2. For research use, lyophilized powder can be reconstituted with sterile saline.
3. Use preservative-free saline for nasal administration to avoid irritation.
4. Calculate concentration based on desired mcg per spray or drop.
5. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated and use within recommended timeframe.
6. Always use sterile technique when preparing nasal formulations.

## Interactions

!!! info "Compatible" - Selank — Synergistic - BPC-157 — Compatible - TB-500 — Compatible

!!! warning "Monitor" - Stimulants — Monitor Combination - NA-Semax-Amidate — Use Caution - MAO-Inhibitors — Use Caution

!!! danger "Avoid" - Concurrent intranasal vasoconstrictors

## Quality Indicators

!!! success - Clear, colorless solution with no particles - Proper concentration labeling (0.1% or 1%) - Cold-chain shipping and immediate refrigeration on arrival - Sterile, sealed packaging

!!! danger - Nasal irritation or crystallization present - Solution is cloudy or discolored - Broken cold chain or improper storage

## What to Expect

- Days 1–3: Initial cognitive clarity and focus enhancement, possible mild nasal sensation
- Week 1: Improved attention span and mental stamina
- Week 2–3: Enhanced memory consolidation and learning capacity
- Week 4: Peak cognitive benefits with improved stress resilience
- Post-cycle: Gradual return to baseline over 3–7 days; some benefits may persist

## Side Effects & Safety

- Start with lowest effective dose (300mcg) to assess response
- Avoid concurrent intranasal vasoconstrictors
- Monitor for nasal irritation, bleeding, or persistent discomfort
- Avoid continuous use beyond 4 weeks without medical supervision
- May enhance stimulant effects; reduce other stimulant doses accordingly
