# Melanotan II

**Tags:** Melanotan II, Tanning, Sexual Function, Melanocortin

!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Melanotan II is a synthetic α-MSH analog that activates melanocortin receptors for rapid UV-free tanning, enhanced sexual function, and appetite suppression. Requires careful dosing to manage side effects; not approved for therapeutic use.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 0.25–1 mg (loading), 1–2× daily initially; maintenance often 0.5–1 mg 2–3× weekly
- **Route:** Injectable — Subcutaneous (abdomen preferred, thigh, upper arm)
- **Cycle:** 4–8 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Melanotan II is a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) that stimulates melanin production for skin tanning and has additional effects on sexual arousal and appetite suppression. Originally developed at the University of Arizona as a sunless tanning agent, it has gained attention for its dual effects on pigmentation and sexual function through melanocortin receptor activation.

## Key Benefits

- Rapid tanning without UV exposure
- Enhanced libido and sexual function
- Appetite suppression
- Improved mood via melanocortin activation

## Mechanism of action

Binds to melanocortin receptors (MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, MC5R). MC1R activation stimulates melanocytes to produce eumelanin; MC4R influences sexual arousal and appetite regulation.

## Research Indications

- UV‑free tanning (Most Effective)
- Photoprotection (increased natural SPF)
- Even pigmentation and some pigmentation disorders
- Hormonal effects (sexual function)

## Research Protocols

| Goal                 |        Dose | Frequency       | Route        |
| -------------------- | ----------: | --------------- | ------------ |
| Initial Loading      |     0.25 mg | Daily           | Subcutaneous |
| Tanning Maintenance  |    0.5–1 mg | 2–3× weekly     | Subcutaneous |
| Sexual Enhancement   |    0.5–1 mg | As needed       | Subcutaneous |
| Minimal Side Effects | 0.1–0.25 mg | Every other day | Subcutaneous |
| Photoprotection      |      0.5 mg | 2× weekly       | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** For tanning: morning dosing preferred. For sexual effects: 2–4 hours before activity. Splitting daily dose can reduce side effects.

## Interactions

!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - Melanotan I — Compatible
    - Photoprotective agents — Compatible
    - Appetite suppressants — May have additive effects

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Antihypertensive agents — Monitor blood pressure; MT-II may elevate BP
    - Stimulants (caffeine, amphetamines) — May amplify cardiovascular effects
    - Photosensitizing medications — Use caution

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - History of melanoma or dysplastic nevi — Contraindicated
    - Uncontrolled hypertension — Avoid; MT-II elevates blood pressure
    - Pregnancy and breastfeeding — Not recommended

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean vial tops with alcohol swab and let dry.
2. Draw 2 mL bacteriostatic water for a 10 mg vial (creates ~5 mg/mL concentration).
3. Inject water slowly down the side of the peptide vial to avoid foaming.
4. Gently roll vial between hands — do not shake vigorously.
5. Solution should be clear to slightly yellow; cloudiness indicates degradation.
6. Store reconstituted peptide refrigerated and wrap in foil (light sensitive).
7. Draw dose with an insulin syringe — typical dose is 0.05–0.2 mL depending on concentration.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White to off-white lyophilized powder (before reconstitution)
    - Clear to pale yellow solution when reconstituted
    - Vacuum-sealed vial with intact seal (pop sound when penetrating stopper is normal)
    - Protected from light exposure (stored in foil-wrapped or amber vials)
    - Clear reconstitution without particles

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Brown or dark powder indicates oxidation/impurities — do not use
    - Cloudy reconstituted solution suggests degradation — discard immediately
    - Broken vial seal or lack of vacuum
    - Exposed to light (not in protective packaging)

## What to expect

- Day 1–3: Possible nausea, flushing, and fatigue after injection
- Day 3–7: Increased spontaneous erections (men), enhanced arousal
- Week 1–2: Noticeable skin darkening, reduced appetite
- Week 2–4: Significant tanning, stabilized sexual effects
- Week 4+: Maintained tan with less frequent dosing

## Side effects & safety

- Start with very low dose (0.1–0.25 mg) to assess tolerance
- Nausea is common; pre-treatment with an antiemetic can help
- Monitor moles and freckles for changes in size or color
- Stay hydrated to minimize headaches and flushing
- Avoid if history of melanoma or dysplastic nevi
- Blood pressure may increase temporarily after injection
