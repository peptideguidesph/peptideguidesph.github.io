# Epitalon (Epithalon, Epithalamin)

!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Epitalon (also called Epithalon or Epithalamin) is a synthetic tetrapeptide (Ala‑Glu‑Asp‑Gly) researched for telomerase activation, melatonin regulation, and potential anti‑aging effects. Typical evidence-based doses are in the microgram range.

## Overview

Epitalon (also called Epithalon or Epithalamin) is a synthetic tetrapeptide (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) modeled on a natural pineal gland peptide. Developed by Vladimir Khavinson and studied for decades, Epitalon is primarily researched as a telomerase activator with potential anti‑aging effects through telomere maintenance, melatonin regulation, and gene‑expression modulation. Note: some Western dosing recommendations may be substantially higher than doses used in original Russian studies.

## Key Benefits

- Telomerase activation and telomere length preservation
- Enhanced melatonin production and improved sleep/circadian rhythms
- Improved immune function and markers of cellular rejuvenation
- Potential lifespan and healthspan benefits in animal studies

## Mechanism of Action

Epitalon appears to stimulate telomerase activity at very low concentrations, modulate pineal function to increase melatonin, influence epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and support antioxidant defenses.

## Molecular Information

- **Weight:** 390.35 Da
- **Length:** 4 amino acids
- **Type:** Tetrapeptide

## Research Indications

- Anti‑aging — telomerase activation and cellular rejuvenation (Most Effective)
- Neuroprotection and circadian restoration (Effective)
- Immune function support (Moderate)
- Experimental longevity interventions (animal evidence)

## Research Protocols

| Goal                         |       Dose | Frequency | Route           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------: | --------- | --------------- |
| Evidence-Based (recommended) | 200–500 μg | Daily     | Subcutaneous    |
| Conservative Start           |     100 μg | Daily     | Subcutaneous    |
| Russian Clinical Equivalent  |     300 μg | Daily     | IM/Subcutaneous |
| Traditional Western (anecd.) |    5–10 mg | Daily     | Subcutaneous    |
| Ultra-Low Dose               |      50 μg | Daily     | Subcutaneous    |

**Timing:** Morning dosing often aligns with cortisol rhythm; some prefer evening dosing for sleep benefits.

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean vial tops with an alcohol swab and allow to dry.
2. Use bacteriostatic water (BAC) and sterile technique.
3. For corrected microgram dosing guidance: add 5 mL BAC water to vial to create desired concentration (example shown in source).
4. Inject water slowly down vial wall to avoid foaming.
5. Gently swirl; do not shake vigorously.
6. Use small syringes (0.3 mL) for microgram dosing accuracy.
7. Refrigerate reconstituted solution and use within recommended window (see Quality Indicators).

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White lyophilized powder before reconstitution
    - Clear, colorless solution after proper mixing
    - Certificate of analysis (COA) showing >98% purity recommended

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Yellow or discolored powder or cloudy solution indicates degradation — do not use
    - Dosing confusion (milligram vs microgram protocols) — verify units on label and COA

## What to Expect

- Days 1–3: often minimal immediate effects; subtle energy or sleep changes reported
- Days 3–7: improved sleep quality, vivid dreams (melatonin effect)
- Week 2: improved morning energy and mood stability
- Weeks 3–4: skin quality and wound‑healing improvements
- Months 1–3: some laboratory markers may show telomere‑related changes after repeated cycles

## Side Effects & Safety

- Generally well tolerated in reported clinical use
- Corrected microgram dosing reduces risk compared with high‑dose anecdotes
- Theoretical cancer concern due to telomerase activation — avoid with active malignancy
- May cause mild injection‑site reactions or vivid dreams

## Quick Start

- **Typical dose:** 200–500 μg per injection (evidence‑based range)
- **How often:** Once daily for 10–20 days per cycle
- **Where to inject:** Subcutaneous — abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
- **Storage:** Refrigerate at 2–8°C; use reconstituted solution within recommended window
- **Cycle length:** 10–20 days; multi‑month breaks between cycles are common (e.g., 4–6 months)
