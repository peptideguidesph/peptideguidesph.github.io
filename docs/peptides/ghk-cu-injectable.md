# GHK-Cu (Injectable)

**Tags:** GHK-Cu, Copper Peptide, Skin Regeneration, Injectable

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    GHK-Cu is a naturally occurring copper tripeptide that declines with age, researched for collagen synthesis, wound healing, and systemic anti-aging effects. Injectable form provides systemic bioavailability.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 1–3 mg (1–2× daily)
- **Route:** Injectable — SubQ (belly, thigh, arm)
- **Cycle:** 8–12 weeks (typical)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

GHK‑Cu is a naturally occurring copper tripeptide found in human plasma, saliva, and urine. Plasma levels decline from ~200 ng/ml at age 20 to ~80 ng/ml by age 60. Research shows it affects a large portion of human gene expression and promotes wound healing, collagen synthesis, and anti‑aging effects. Injectable GHK‑Cu provides systemic bioavailability but is not FDA‑approved; most high‑quality clinical evidence is from topical studies and animal models.

## Key Benefits

- Maximum bioavailability and systemic anti‑aging effects
- Enhanced collagen production and deep dermal remodeling
- Accelerated wound healing and improved angiogenesis
- Hair growth stimulation

## Mechanism of action

Injectable GHK‑Cu activates multiple cellular pathways including collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and tissue remodeling genes that support comprehensive anti‑aging effects.

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 404.96 Da
- **Length:** 3 amino acids
- **Type:** Copper tripeptide

**Amino Acid Sequence:**

```
Gly-His-Lys
```

_Complexed with copper (Cu2+) for enhanced bioavailability._

## Research indications

- Anti‑inflammatory
- Skin regeneration
- Hair growth stimulation
- Wound healing

## Research protocols

| Goal                     |   Dose | Frequency | Route                   |
| ------------------------ | -----: | :-------: | ----------------------- |
| Anti‑aging / Skin health | 1–2 mg | 1× daily  | SubQ injection          |
| Hair growth stimulation  | 2–3 mg | 1× daily  | SubQ injection          |
| Wound healing            | 1–2 mg | 2× daily  | SubQ near affected area |
| General wellness         |   1 mg | 1× daily  | SubQ injection          |
| Intensive repair         | 2–3 mg | 1× daily  | SubQ injection          |

**Timing:** Injectable GHK‑Cu is usually administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites to prevent irritation. Consistent timing supports steady levels.

    - Copper supplements — May increase toxicity risk

## How to reconstitute

1. Allow vial to reach room temperature (15–20 minutes).
2. Clean vial tops and injection sites with alcohol swabs.
3. Draw calculated amount of bacteriostatic water (BAC) into syringe.
4. Inject slowly down the vial side to avoid direct contact with powder.
5. Gently swirl until fully dissolved (characteristic light blue color).
6. Store reconstituted solution in refrigerator at 2–8°C and use within 30 days.

**Important:** Always use bacteriostatic water (BAC) and sterile technique.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Blue-tinted powder (characteristic from copper content)
    - Complete dissolution to a clear light-blue solution with no particles
    - Stable light blue coloration after reconstitution
    - Professional packaging with sterile seals and batch information

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Green/dark blue discoloration or persistent cloudiness — do not use

## Side effects & safety

- Monitor injection sites for unusual blue discoloration
- Start with lower doses to assess copper tolerance
- Use sterile injection technique to prevent infection
- Watch for signs of copper toxicity (nausea, metallic taste)
- Avoid excessive copper supplementation from other sources
