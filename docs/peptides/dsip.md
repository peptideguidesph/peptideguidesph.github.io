!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide) is a naturally occurring nonapeptide researched for improving slow-wave sleep, reducing sleep latency, and modulating stress and pain pathways. Clinical evidence is limited but suggests potential benefits for sleep and recovery.

## Overview

DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide) is a naturally occurring nonapeptide (Trp-Ala-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ser-Gly-Glu) first isolated in 1974 from rabbit brain. Originally identified for sleep-promoting properties, DSIP has since been investigated for broader neuromodulatory effects including stress reduction, pain modulation, and endocrine regulation. Clinical efficacy and mechanisms remain under active research.

## Key Benefits

- Promotes deep (delta) slow-wave sleep
- Reduces sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings without morning grogginess
- May reduce stress and cortisol through HPA-axis modulation
- Potential pain-relief effects in some clinical reports

## Mechanism of Action

DSIP appears to modulate multiple neurotransmitter systems (GABA, NMDA, endogenous opioid pathways) and influence the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, supporting natural sleep architecture rather than producing sedation.

## Molecular Information

- **Type:** Nonapeptide
- **Sequence:** Trp-Ala-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ser-Gly-Glu
- **Length:** 9 amino acids

## Research Indications

- Sleep: deep-sleep enhancement and improved sleep efficiency (Most Effective)
- Mood: anxiety and mood stabilization (Effective)
- Chronic pain: reported benefit in small clinical series
- Stress management and withdrawal support
- Athletic recovery (short-term protocols)

## Research Protocols

| Goal               |        Dose | Frequency     | Route        |
| ------------------ | ----------: | ------------- | ------------ |
| Sleep Enhancement  | 100–200 mcg | Once nightly  | Subcutaneous |
| Chronic Pain       | 250–300 mcg | Daily         | IV or SubQ   |
| Stress Management  |     150 mcg | Evening       | Subcutaneous |
| Withdrawal Support | 200–300 mcg | Twice daily   | IV preferred |
| Athletic Recovery  | 100–150 mcg | Post-training | Subcutaneous |

**Timing:** Best taken 30–60 minutes before intended bedtime; some prefer earlier evening dosing (2–3 hours) for gradual onset. Consistent timing improves outcomes.

## How to Reconstitute

1. Clean vial tops with an alcohol swab and let dry completely.
2. Always use bacteriostatic water (BAC) and sterile technique.
3. For a 1 mg vial, add 1 mL BAC water (creates 1 mg/mL or 1000 mcg/mL).
4. Inject water slowly down the vial wall to minimize foaming.
5. Gently roll between palms; do not shake.
6. Solution should be clear and colorless after mixing.
7. For a 100 mcg dose, draw 0.1 mL (10 units on an insulin syringe).
8. Store reconstituted peptide in the refrigerator immediately.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White to off-white lyophilized powder before reconstitution
    - Clear, colorless solution after proper mixing
    - Short stability window — use reconstituted solution within 14 days
    - Source quality and third‑party testing (COA) are essential due to instability
    - Minimize light and temperature fluctuations to protect the peptide

!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Yellow or cloudy solution indicates degradation or contamination — discard

## What to Expect

- First dose: noticeable sleep pressure and easier sleep onset
- Night 1–3: deeper sleep, fewer awakenings, vivid dreams possible
- Day 2–5: improved morning refreshment and daytime energy
- Day 5–10: cumulative stress reduction and mood improvements
- Post-cycle: benefits may persist 1–2 weeks after stopping

## Side Effects & Safety

- Generally well tolerated with minimal side effects in reported series
- Possible mild drowsiness or dizziness initially
- Occasional headaches reported in sensitive individuals
- No tolerance or dependence reported in studies to date
- Avoid driving until individual response is known
- Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding

## Quick Start

- **Typical dose:** 100–200 mcg per injection
- **How often:** Once daily, 30–60 minutes before bed
- **Where to inject:** Subcutaneous — abdomen, thigh, upper arm
- **Storage:** Refrigerate 2–8°C; protect from light; use within 14 days
- **Cycle length:** 5–10 consecutive days; 2–4 week break between cycles
