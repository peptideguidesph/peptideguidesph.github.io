<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    The Glow Protocol is a combination peptide injection containing BPC-157, TB-500, and GHK-Cu marketed for skin rejuvenation and anti-aging. Careful dosing is required to ensure individual peptides remain within therapeutic ranges.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** Varies by formulation — calculate individual peptide amounts
- **Route:** Injectable (subcutaneous) — abdominal area, outer thigh, upper arm
- **Cycle:** 8–12 weeks (monitor accumulation and individual peptide requirements)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C — refrigerate, protect from light

## Overview

The Glow Protocol is a combination injection containing BPC-157, TB-500, and GHK-Cu (copper peptide) marketed for skin rejuvenation and anti-aging. Individual components have supporting research, but combination products require careful dosing to avoid delivering individual peptides outside their therapeutic ranges.

## Key Benefits

- Combination delivery of three regenerative peptides in a single injection
- Targets wound healing, angiogenesis, and collagen stimulation

## Mechanism of action

- BPC-157: anti-inflammatory and tissue repair effects
- TB-500: supports angiogenesis and tissue remodeling
- GHK-Cu: stimulates collagen production and skin repair

## Research indications

- Skin rejuvenation — most effective
- Wound healing — effective in many contexts
- Dosing concerns — moderate; individual responses vary with formulation

## Research protocols

| Goal                           |                                 Dose |                       Frequency | Route                  |
| ------------------------------ | -----------------------------------: | ------------------------------: | ---------------------- |
| Conservative approach          | Calculate individual peptide amounts | Based on component requirements | Subcutaneous injection |
| Standard protocol              |              Per supplier guidelines |                  As recommended | Subcutaneous injection |
| Individual peptide alternative |                    Separate peptides |             Optimized schedules | Multiple injections    |

Timing note: consider each peptide's half-life and optimal schedule when planning combination dosing.

## Interactions

!!! info "Compatible / Complementary"

    - NAD+ precursors — Generally compatible
    - Vitamin C — Generally compatible

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Monitor"

    - Retinoids — Timing required
    - AHA/BHA — Timing required
    - Individual GHK-Cu dosing — Monitor for copper accumulation
    - Individual BPC-157 dosing — May interact

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Avoid"

    - Some combinations with individual GHK-Cu and BPC-157 should be avoided — consult healthcare provider

## How to reconstitute

1. Verify vial contents and individual peptide amounts before reconstitution.
2. Calculate the target concentration based on each peptide's therapeutic dose.
3. Allow vial and bacteriostatic water to reach room temperature before mixing.
4. Clean vial tops with alcohol swabs and let air dry completely.
5. Add the calculated volume of bacteriostatic water for the desired concentration.
6. Insert the needle at an angle and inject the water slowly down the vial wall to avoid foaming.
7. Gently swirl until fully dissolved (do not shake vigorously).
8. Label the vial with reconstitution date, total volume, and calculated individual peptide concentrations.
9. Store refrigerated at 2–8°C and use within 28 days.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - Clear solution when properly reconstituted; no particles
    - Vial lists individual peptide amounts (not just total weight)
    - Temporary blue-green copper discoloration at injection sites is normal

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Individual peptide amounts exceed recommended therapeutic ranges — do not use
    - Cloudiness or particles present

## What to expect

- Individual responses vary significantly based on peptide ratios in a formulation
- Effects are primarily from individual component peptides rather than guaranteed synergy
- May require dose adjustments based on tolerance to each peptide
- Consider using individual peptides if combination ratios are not optimal for you

## Side effects & safety

- CRITICAL: calculate individual peptide doses before starting any combination protocol
- Combination ratios can exceed therapeutic ranges for some peptides — monitor carefully
- Monitor for copper accumulation effects (temporary skin discoloration)
- Start with minimal doses to assess tolerance and consult a healthcare provider experienced with peptide dosing
