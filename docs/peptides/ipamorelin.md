!!! abstract "Quick Summary"

    Ipamorelin is a selective growth hormone releasing peptide that stimulates natural GH pulses with minimal effects on cortisol and prolactin. Commonly used for recovery, body composition, and anti-aging with an excellent safety profile.

## Quick Facts

- **Typical Dose:** 200–300 mcg
- **Frequency:** 1–3× daily (depends on goal)
- **Route:** Injectable — belly, thigh, upper arm (SubQ)
- **Cycle:** 3–6 months (monitor receptor sensitivity)
- **Storage:** 2–8°C (refrigerated)

## Overview

Ipamorelin is a selective growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) that stimulates natural growth hormone release from the pituitary. It is noted for a clean profile with minimal effects on cortisol and prolactin, making it commonly used for body composition, recovery, and anti‑aging purposes.

## Key Benefits

- Stimulates natural GH pulses with predictable timing
- Supports recovery, lean mass, and metabolic function
- Minimal off-target effects on cortisol and prolactin

## Mechanism of action

- Binds selectively to ghrelin receptors in the pituitary to trigger GH release
- Produces a GH pulse ~30–60 minutes after injection while preserving natural pulsatility

## Molecular information

- **Weight:** 711.85 Da
- **Length:** 5 amino acids
- **Type:** Growth hormone secretagogue

**Amino acid sequence:**

```
Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH2
```

_Contains non-natural amino acids (Aib, D-2-Nal, D-Phe) and C-terminal amidation._

## Research indications

- Growth hormone stimulation — most effective
- Body composition improvements
- Recovery and sleep optimization
- Anti-aging protocols

## Research protocols

| Goal                       |        Dose |                       Frequency | Route |
| -------------------------- | ----------: | ------------------------------: | ----- |
| General Health & Longevity |     200 mcg |           1× daily (before bed) | SubQ  |
| Body Composition           | 250–300 mcg | 2× daily (morning, pre-workout) | SubQ  |
| Athletic Performance       | 200–250 mcg |                      2–3× daily | SubQ  |
| Sleep & Recovery           |     200 mcg |    1× daily (30 min before bed) | SubQ  |
| Anti-Aging Protocol        | 200–250 mcg |                      1–2× daily | SubQ  |

**Timing:** Empty stomach injections are generally recommended; bedtime dosing favors sleep and recovery benefits.

## How to reconstitute

1. Clean work area and hands with antibacterial soap.
2. Allow refrigerated peptide to reach room temperature.
3. Calculate required bacteriostatic water (BAC) volume using a calculator.
4. Draw BAC into syringe and inject slowly down the vial wall (avoid spraying powder).
5. Gently swirl until dissolved (do not shake vigorously).
6. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated and use within 28 days.

## Quality Indicators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Positive Signs"

    - White, fine crystalline powder with no clumping
    - Clear solution after reconstitution without particles
    - Mild hunger response 20–30 minutes post-injection indicates activity

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! danger "Warning Signs"

    - Discolored or yellow powder suggests degradation — do not use

## What to expect

- Week 1–2: Improved sleep quality and deeper sleep
- Week 2–4: Enhanced recovery and reduced muscle soreness
- Week 4–8: Body composition shifts — increased lean mass, reduced fat
- Week 8–12: Continued improvements in muscle tone, skin, and energy
- Side effects: minimal; occasional mild hunger 20–30 minutes after injection

## Side effects & safety

- Use sterile injection technique to prevent infection
- Generally well tolerated with an excellent safety profile
- May cause mild hunger increase 20–30 minutes post-injection
- Monitor for receptor desensitization after 3–4 months; consider cycling off periodically
- Not recommended during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or active cancer
