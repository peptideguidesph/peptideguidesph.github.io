## Big Red Flags – Run Away

!!! danger "Avoid these suppliers"

| What They Say                                                                      | Why It's a Red Flag                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We only have manufacturer COA" or "We don't have COA under our shop name"         | Anyone can download a fake COA from Google Images. They're not willing to verify what they're actually sending you.                               |
| "Third-party testing is too expensive"                                             | They're prioritizing their profits over your health and safety. Real sellers invest in testing.                                                   |
| "I'm a seller but I'm using my own peptides and I didn't test but I'm still alive" | Just because nothing has happened to them yet doesn't mean it's safe for you. Would you wait for a catastrophe to happen before we start testing? |
| Takes longer than 24 hours to answer simple questions                              | If they're slow now, imagine needing urgent help with side effects later.                                                                         |
| Gives wrong or vague answers about the peptide (half-life, storage, dosing, etc.)  | They don't know what they're selling. This is dangerous.                                                                                          |
| Never asks about your health or experience level                                   | They don't care if you're a beginner or have contraindications. Only profit matters.                                                              |
