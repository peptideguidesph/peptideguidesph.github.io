# Can I Take Peptides

!!! success "Short Answer: Yes, But..."
Many healthy adults can safely try peptides, but **not everyone**. It depends on your health, age, medical history, and goals.

Peptides aren't magic pills → they work best alongside a solid diet, exercise, and sleep routine.

## First: Always Consult a Doctor

!!! warning "Non-Negotiable Step"
Never start without clearance from a licensed physician, especially if you have chronic conditions.

Get baseline blood work (at minimum in the Philippines → use labs like Hi-Precision or Maxicare):

- Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
- Lipid panel and fasting glucose/HbA1c (key for GLP-1 peptides like tirzepatide)
- Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4) → peptides can influence hormones
- IGF-1 if using growth-related peptides
