# How To Use Peptides

!!! success "The entire process is only 3 steps"
**1. Mix → 2. Draw → 3. Inject**  
After 2–3 tries it takes less than 60 seconds and becomes completely automatic.

## Step 1: Reconstitute the Peptide

!!! tip "Reconstitution – Do it once per vial"

1. You receive a small glass vial with freeze-dried white (or slightly yellow) powder.
2. Use **bacteriostatic water** (BAC water) → never regular water or saline.
3. Wipe both rubber tops with an alcohol swab.
4. Draw 1–2 ml of BAC water with a large syringe (3 ml is fine).
5. Slowly drip the water down the inside wall of the vial → try to not blast the powder directly. But if you accidentally push the water in the powder, that's also okay.
6. Gently roll or swirl the vial until fully dissolved (usually 1–2 minutes).  
   **Never shake vigorously** → it can damage the peptide chain.
7. Write the mixing date on the vial.
8. Store in the refrigerator door (2–8 °C). Good for 4–6 weeks.

## Step 2: Draw the Correct Dose

!!! tip "Always use a peptide calculator"

- Use **insulin syringes** (0.3 ml, 0.5 ml or 1 ml – 31G or 30G is almost painless).
- Popular free calculators: [Peptide Calculator](https://particlepeptides.com/en/content/48-peptide-calculator) or [Peptide Calculator](https://primepeptides.co/peptide-calculator/)

## Step 3: Inject Subcutaneously (Fat Layer)

!!! tip "Easiest & safest method"
Best sites (rotate daily):

- Belly fat (2 inches away from navel)
- Love handles
- Front or outer thigh
- Back of upper arm (if someone helps)

**How to inject**:

1. Clean skin with alcohol swab.
2. Pinch 2–3 inches of fat.
3. Insert needle quickly at 90°.
4. Push plunger slowly (3–5 seconds).
5. Pull out → no need to rub.
6. Dispose syringe in a thick plastic bottle, ice cream container, or sharps container.

## When Should I Inject?

!!! info "Timing depends on the peptide"
| Peptide type | Best time |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| BPC-157, TB-500 | Daily, morning or night |
| Tirzepatide / Retatrutide / Semaglutide | Same day every week |
| GHK-Cu (skin) | Daily, morning or night |

Detailed timing for every peptide is in its own guide → check the **[Peptides](../peptides)** section.

!!! success "You’ve got this!"
    After your first week you’ll do the whole process with your eyes closed.  
    Start slow, stay consistent, and always listen to your body.
