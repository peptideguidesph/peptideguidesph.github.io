# What Are Peptides

!!! success "Simple definition"
:lucide-atom: **Peptides are short chains of amino acids** → basically tiny proteins that act like messenger molecules in your body.

:lucide-flame: They tell your cells to heal faster, burn fat, build muscle, produce collagen, and more.

:lucide-test-tube: Most peptides you see online arrive as **freeze-dried (lyophilized) white powder** in small glass vials. This form stays stable even in hot and humid Philippine weather.

## Why Do Most Peptides Need to Be Injected?

!!! tip "It’s the only way they actually work"

- Many peptides are destroyed by stomach acid if you swallow them
- Tiny subcutaneous injection (into the fat) → goes straight into the blood → nearly 100 % absorption

**Good news**: the needle is an ultra-thin insulin syringe (30G–31G).  
Most people say it hurts **less than plucking eyebrows or a mosquito bite**.  
After the first few times you won’t even feel it.
