## How They Actually Work

!!! tip "All three do the same core things"

- Make you feel full faster and longer
- Kill sugar and junk-food cravings
- Slow stomach emptying
- Help your body burn more fat (especially tirzepatide & retatrutide)
- Keep blood sugar stable (great if you eat a lot of rice)

Tirzepatide is usually the “sweet spot” for most Filipinos: strong results with fewer side effects than semaglutide.
