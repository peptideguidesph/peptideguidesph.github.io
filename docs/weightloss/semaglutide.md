## Why Semaglutide Is Still Extremely Popular

!!! success "In simple terms"
Semaglutide is a pure **GLP-1** peptide → the original that started the whole revolution (Ozempic / Wegovy).  
It is slightly less powerful than tirzepatide, but it is cheaper, easier to find, and has the longest real-world track record.

Average results (clinical trials):

- 12–15 % body weight in 48 weeks
- 15–18 % in 68–72 weeks

## Recommended Dosing Strategy

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Golden rule: Only increase when appetite comes back"
    Stay on the lowest dose that keeps you satisfied and losing 0.5–1 kg per week.  
    No need to rush to higher doses  →  many stay on 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg forever.

| Week | Suggested Dose (once weekly) | Rule of Thumb                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1–4  | 0.25 mg                      | Mandatory starting dose                |
| 5–8  | 0.5 mg                       | Most people stay here long-term        |
| 9–16 | 1.0 mg                       | Move up only if hunger returns         |
| 17+  | 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg             | Only if you truly plateau (rare in PH) |

**Real Filipino example**

- Month 1–8 → stay on 0.5 mg (still losing steadily)
- Month 9+ → go to 1.0 mg only when weight loss slows
- Year 2 → most stay on 0.5–1.0 mg maintenance forever

| Week 3–8  | Steady 0.5–1 kg per week, clothes get loose     |
| Month 3–6 | 8–15 kg down, face and waist noticeably smaller |
| Month 12  | 15–25 kg total loss is very common              |
