## Why Tirzepatide Is So Popular in the Philippines Right Now

!!! success "In simple terms"
Tirzepatide is a **dual GLP-1 + GIP** peptide.  
It mimics two gut hormones at once → you feel full very quickly, cravings disappear, and your body burns fat faster than with semaglutide alone.

Average results from real users and clinical trials:

- 15–18 % body weight in 48 weeks
- 20–22 % in 72 weeks

## Recommended Dosing Strategy

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Golden rule: Only increase the dose when the day your appetite starts coming back"
    Stay on the lowest dose that keeps you full and losing 0.5–1 kg per week.  
    There is **no rush** to go up. Many people stay on 5 mg or 7.5 mg forever and keep losing.

| Week | Suggested Dose | Rule of Thumb                                   |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1–4  | 2.5 mg         | Mandatory starting dose                         |
| 5+   | 5.0 mg         | Move up only if hunger returns                  |
| 9+   | 7.5 mg         | Move up only if hunger returns                  |
| 13+  | 10 mg          | Move up only if hunger returns                  |
| 21+  | 12.5 or 15 mg  | Only for very large individuals or true plateau |
