## Why Retatrutide Is Creating So Much Hype

!!! success "In simple terms"
Retatrutide is the world’s first **triple agonist** → GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon all in one molecule.  
This extra glucagon action makes your body burn more calories even while resting → the highest weight-loss numbers ever recorded in trials.

Current data (Phase 3 trials + early research users 2025):

- 22–24 % body weight at 48 weeks
- Some people hitting **28–30 %** at 72 weeks

## Recommended Dosing Strategy

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Golden rule: Only increase when appetite returns  →  exactly like tirzepatide"
    Stay on the lowest dose that keeps you full and losing 0.7–1.5 kg per week.  
    Most people never need to go above 8 mg.

| Week | Suggested Dose (once weekly) | Rule of Thumb                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1–4  | 1 mg                         | Mandatory starting dose                         |
| 5–8  | 2 mg                         | Most early users stay here                      |
| 9–16 | 4 mg                         | Move up only if hunger returns                  |
| 17+  | 8 mg                         | Common long-term dose                           |
| 21+  | 12 mg                        | Only for very large individuals or true plateau |

## Expected Timeline

| Time      | What most people experience                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1–4  | Possible nausea                               |
| Week 5-8  | Rapid 1 kg per week, energy noticeably higher |
| Month 3–6 | 15–25 kg down, major body recomposition       |
| Month 12  | 30–45+ kg total loss is becoming common       |

## Side Effects & How to Handle Them

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Side effects are similar to tirzepatide but can include slight increase in heart rate"
    - Nausea & vomiting → start at 1 mg, inject at night  
    - Faster heartbeat (10–15 bpm increase) → normal, goes away after a few weeks  
    - Constipation/diarrhea → same fixes as others  
    - Mild sweating or feeling warm → glucagon effect

Heart-rate increase is usually harmless but monitor if you have heart conditions.

!!! success "Bottom line"
    Retatrutide is currently the **strongest weight-loss peptide** as of 2025.  
    It is newer and slightly harder to source, but the results are unmatched for people who tolerate it well.
