# Reconstituted Peptides (Liquid Form)

When you mix **dry powder peptides** with **bacteriostatic water**, you get a **liquid solution** ready to inject. This is called **reconstitution**.

Most people prefer this form because it's easier to measure and use than dry powder.

## How to Mix It Right

- **Always use bacteriostatic water (bac water)** → not regular water or sterile water.
- **Do NOT shake hard** → this can damage the peptide. Instead, gently roll or swirl the vial until the powder fully dissolves.
- **Refrigerate immediately** after mixing (keep at 2–8°C).
- **Use it within 5 weeks** → reconstituted peptides don't last as long as powder.

## 🔍 The Bottom Line

**You cannot judge quality by looking.** A clear liquid might still be fake or impure.

If you are buying **already reconstituted** peptides from a seller, always ask for a [**recent COA**](../coa.md "Why is COA so important?"). If you are **reconstituting powder yourself**, make sure the powder had a COA before mixing.
