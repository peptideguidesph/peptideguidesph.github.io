# Best Time to Inject GLP-1 Peptides

Many people ask: **Should I inject in the morning or at night? What time is best?**

The honest answer: **The best time is the time you can do it consistently every week.** The exact time matters much less than staying on schedule.

## ✅ How to Choose Your Time

- GLP-1 peptides like semaglutide and tirzepatide are injected **once per week**
- Pick a **day and time that fits your routine** (example: every Sunday morning at 8am)
- **Write it on your calendar** so you don't forget
- Try to keep the **same day and time every week** for best results
- It's fine to inject **with or without food** → both work equally well

## 🌙 Morning or Night? Here's What Matters

**Morning Injection:**

- You can **watch for side effects** during the day
- You'll know right away if something feels wrong
- Easier to remember because you're already awake

**Night Injection:**

- Some people sleep through the nausea or discomfort
- Less disruption to your daytime routine
- You can rest after the injection

**The truth:** Both work equally well. Choose what makes **you** most comfortable and most likely to remember.

## ⚠️ When to Skip Your Injection

- **You're very sick or vomiting** → wait until you feel better
- **You're severely dehydrated** → stay hydrated first
- **Your doctor told you to pause** → always follow their advice
- **You missed a week?** → Just take your next dose on schedule. Do NOT double the dose to "catch up."

## 🔍 Final Note

**Consistency beats perfection.** It's better to inject every Sunday at 9pm than to stress about whether 8am or 9pm is "better." Find your rhythm and stick to it.
