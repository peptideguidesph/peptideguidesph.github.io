# What to Look for in Lyophilized Peptides

Lyophilized peptides are **freeze-dried powder** stored in small glass vials. They look like a **white or off-white powder or "cake"** at the bottom of the vial.

The appearance can give you **helpful clues** about quality, but remember: **only independent lab testing (COA) can truly confirm purity and identity**. Don't rely on appearance alone.

---

## ✅ Good Signs

- **Solid cake** at the bottom of the vial
- **White or slightly off-white** color
- Powder is **not sticking to the glass**
- No liquid inside the vial (it should be dry)

---

## ⚠️ Warning Signs

- **No cake** at all (looks empty)
- **Wet or melted** powder
- Strange **colors** (yellow, brown, etc.)
- **Floating particles** or broken glass inside

## 🔍 The Bottom Line

**Your eyes are not enough.** Even if the powder looks perfect, it could still be fake or impure.

Always ask your seller for a **recent COA (Certificate of Analysis)** from an independent lab. This is the only real proof of what you're buying.
