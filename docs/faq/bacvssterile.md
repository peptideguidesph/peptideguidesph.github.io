# Bac Water vs Sterile Water

When you mix dry peptides, you need to choose the right water. **Bacteriostatic water (bac water)** and **sterile water** are not the same → and this difference matters a lot.

---

## 💧 Bacteriostatic Water (Bac Water)

This is water with an added **preservative (benzyl alcohol)** that stops bacteria from growing.

✅ **Advantages:**

- Safe to use **multiple times** → you can inject from the same vial over several weeks
- Lasts longer (up to **28 days**)
- Better for shared or multi-use vials
- This is what **most peptide users choose**

---

## 💧 Sterile Water

This is **pure water with no additives** → completely clean and safe.

❌ **Disadvantages:**

- Only safe for **one-time use** → use it once, then throw it away
- Without preservatives, bacteria can grow quickly if you reuse it
- Risky for peptides because vials are usually used multiple times
- **Not recommended** for peptide mixing

## ⚠️ Quick Comparison

|                        | Bac Water            | Sterile Water        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Preservative?**      | Yes (stops bacteria) | No                   |
| **Can reuse?**         | Yes → up to 28 days  | No → single use only |
| **Risk if reused?**    | Low                  | Very high            |
| **Best for peptides?** | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                |

**Bottom line: Use bacteriostatic water. Sterile water is too risky for peptides.**
