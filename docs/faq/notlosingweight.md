# Not Losing Weight on 2.5mg Tirzepatide?

You started tirzepatide at **2.5mg and haven't seen weight loss yet.** This is **completely normal** and doesn't mean the medicine isn't working.

Here's why:

## ✅ Why You Might Not Be Losing Weight Yet

**2.5mg is just the starting dose.** Here's the real deal:

- **Your body is adjusting** → The first dose is low to let your body get used to the medicine and reduce side effects
- **You need a higher dose** → Most people don't see real weight loss until they reach **5mg, 7.5mg, or higher**
- **Everyone progresses at different speeds** → Some people feel effects at 2.5mg, but most need to go up
- **It takes time** → Even at the right dose, weight loss usually shows after **4-12 weeks**, not immediately
- **Your body is still adjusting** → Appetite suppression gets stronger as you keep using it

## ⚠️ What You Should Do Now

**Be patient and follow your titration schedule:**

- **Don't speed up your doses** → your doctor planned a schedule for a reason
- **Start healthy habits now** → even before the weight loss kicks in, improve your diet and exercise
- **Track other changes too** → sometimes appetite control happens before weight loss
- **Give it 8-12 weeks** → at the right dose, you should start seeing results
- **If still nothing after 3+ doses** → talk to your doctor. Maybe you need a higher dose, or maybe this medication isn't right for you

**Remember:** This medicine works best when you also work. Diet and exercise aren't optional → they're part of the system.

## 🔍 The Bottom Line
