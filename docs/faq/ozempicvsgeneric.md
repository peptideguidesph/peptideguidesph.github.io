# Ozempic / Mounjaro versus Generic

Many people ask: **What is the difference between brand name medicines and generic versions sold online?**

Here is the simple answer:

- **Ozempic® / Mounjaro®** → Official medicines approved by the FDA. Made in regulated factories with strict quality control.
- **Generic vials** → Usually sold as _research chemicals_. **Not approved medicines.** Made in unregulated facilities.

## Why This Matters

When you buy generic versions online, you are taking a big risk:

- Quality and purity are **NOT guaranteed** → they could be anything inside that vial.
- Labels may be **fake or incorrect** → you don't know what you're really getting.
- If something goes wrong, **no company is responsible** → there's no safety net.
- Doctors cannot safely prescribe them because **they have no quality guarantee**.

## What You Should Do

If you choose to use generic versions, **always ask for independent lab testing (COA)**. This is your only proof of what's actually inside. Don't trust the seller's word alone → trust the lab report.
